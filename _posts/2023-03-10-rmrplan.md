# Skit - Merge Sort (Watermelon Fair)

1. Fun Scenario -> (Person) wants to sort how big each of his prize winning watermelons are, but he doesn't have them in order!
2. Amongst ourselves, we each grab a random number sticky note from a bucket
3. We all stand in a line, unsorted
4. (Person) says "how do we sort this??"
5. Narrator says "we will do a MERGE sort"
6. then we go into each part involved in the merge sort
7. Narrator describes each element part of the sort
8. Meanwhile, there is an associated fastpage that gives code behind each part of the skit AS THE SKIT CONTINUES
9. Eventually, the sort finishes and the numbers are in order
