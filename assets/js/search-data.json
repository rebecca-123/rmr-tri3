Selection sort is a linear sort algorithm as it moves from index [0] to [n-1]. In an inner loop it in a second linear loop that compares two elements (like seen in the visual below) and notes which is smallest, after cycling to the end it swaps the smallest number to the lowest in the round. . . Insertion Sort Lecture on Arrays/ArrayLists -- Sample code that Sorts Objects . Insertion sort is another linear algorithm that sorts elements from index [0] to index [n-1]. In the inner loop of this algorithm, it find the gap, insertion point for the next item and inserts it. Each inner loop leave the list partially sorted according to outer loops index. . | . . Merge Sort Algorithm part 1, Algorithm part 2 . This algorithm uses a divide and conquer algorithm, versus linear algorithm of insertion or selection sort. Looking at it can be complicated, but it is more simple than it looks. It divides the array into two different groups recursively, until it gets only two to compare, swaps if necessary. Then it pops out of the recursion, observe the cascading and then the inverted assembly in illustration, after pop it puts each split group back together using a sorted comparison. . | . . Hacks .

            "content": "Arrays, ArrayList, 2D Arrays . Most &quot;Data Structures&quot; conversations begin with Arrays, which are built into most Computer Programming Languages. College Board has CSA Units 6-8 which discuss Arrays, ArrayLists, and 2-Dimensional Arrays. . Arrays, 2D Arrays, and ArrayLists are important data structures in computer science, and they are the subject of two FRQs in each AP Computer Science A exam. Here are some types of FRQs that may focus on these topics: . Array/ArrayList implementation: You may be asked to implement an Array or ArrayList, including methods to add, remove, and access elements. | Array/ArrayList traversal: You may be given an Array or ArrayList and asked to traverse it, perform operations on each element, and/or modify the array or list. | Array/ArrayList searching and sorting: You may be asked to implement or modify code to search for an element in an array or list, or to sort the elements of an array or list. | 2D Arrays or Multi-dimensional arrays: You may be asked to implement or modify code that uses a multi-dimensional array, and to perform operations on elements of the array. | ArrayList vs. Array: You may be asked to compare and contrast the characteristics of ArrayLists and Arrays, and to explain when it is appropriate to use one data structure over the other. | Big-O complexity: You may be asked to analyze the time and space complexity of algorithms that use Arrays or ArrayLists, and to compare the efficiency of different algorithms. | Collection Framework in Java . A deeper dive into Data Structures continues with Linked Lists (LL) which are the foundation for Stacks and Queues, which we have used. Java has implemented a Collection framework that has established common methods to assist in using many of these Data Structures. .

Deeper reference from Geeks . In my experience, building your own Data Structures can help you to understand fundamentals of a Computer Language. To use a Data Structure you will need data. The developer working with LL, Stacks, and Queues needs to can learn how to manage different Data Types, this helps you learn about the Java Data Type Object as a generic form of an instance of a class and the Generic type &lt;T&gt; as generic for of a Data Type within a class definition. . Generics. The purpose of this &quot;class&quot; is to show how we can combine any Data Type into a super class.

            "title": "Pull Request Guide",
            "content": "What is a Pull Request? . A pull request is a method of submitting contributions to an open development project. It occurs when a developer asks for changes committed to an external repository to be considered for inclusion in a project&#39;s main repository after the peer review. Pull requests are used by teams and organizations using the shared repository model. The idea behind a pull request is that someone forks an existing repository, makes changes to it, and then sends a pull request asking to merge their changes into the original repository. The pull request shows the differences of the content from both branches. The changes are not merged until a reviewer(s) approves the pull request. . Why is it important? . Pull requests are vital to our success in tri 3 of CSA. With teams being sa big as 13 people. Committing every change to a singular repository is confusing and potentially harmful. In order to stay organized and ensure projects are developed efficiently and effectively, we use pull requests. Benefits to using pull requests: . Allows for peer review of code, a crucial step in the development process | Allows for a more organized workflow | Ensures requirements are being met on each commit | Allows everyone to contribute to the project | Keeps main repository secure and clean | Can sync with issues and close issues upon being accepted | Many Github bots and tools to assist with pull requests | . How to make a pull request . As a developer . Step 1: Fork the repository . Forking a repository is creating a copy of the repository under your own account. This allows you to make changes to the repository without affecting the original repository. To fork a repository, click the fork button in the top right corner of the repository page. This will create a copy of the repository under your account. . If the fork button is grayed out, you do not have permission to fork the repository. Contact the repository owner to request access. See &quot;as a maintainer&quot; to learn how to setup repository for pull requests. . Step 2: Clone the forked repository . Cloning a repository is creating a local copy of the repository on your computer. This allows you to make changes to the repository without affecting the original repository. If you do not know how to clone repositories, check out the official github docs here . Step 3: Make changes to the forked repository . Now that you have a local copy of the repository, you can make changes to the repository. Make sure to follow contributing guidelines of the repository, if any. Once you are finished editing, commit and push your changes to your forked changes. Commiting docs can be found here . Step 4: Create a pull request . Now that you have made changes to the repository, you can create a pull request. Navigate to your forked repository, and click the contribute dropdown. Then click open pull request. This will open a new page where you can create a pull request. . . Your browser should open to a page like this. Verify the branches and repositories automatically supplied by Github are correct. Ensure you provide an accurate title and description of the pull request. You can mention specific issues in the parent repository by typing # and the issue number. For our purposes, ensure you allow edits from mainteners. Once satisfied, click create pull request. . . Note: If you are still working on the pull request, you can click convert to draft to prevent the pull request from being merged. You can also add commits to your pull request later or edit the changes. . Step 5: Wait for review . Once you have created a pull request, you must wait for a maintainer to review your pull request. Watch out for comments from maintainers and project members, and ensure you update your request as needed. Once the pull request is approved, it will be merged into the main repository. . As a maintainer . Step 1: Setup repository for pull requests . In order to allow for pull requests, you must enable the repository for pull request. To ensure forking is allowed, navigate to the settings tab of the repository. Then click manage access. Then click allow members to create forks. . Step 2: Setup maintainers . Before you can merge pull requests, you must add maintainers to the repository. Add members to the repository you trust to review and merge pull requests. To add a maintainer, navigate to the settings tab of the repository. If adding individual members, give them write access. If adding a team, give them maintain access. . Good Practices . Create and follow a contributing guide for best results Follow code guidelines specified by class Be descriptive . Resources .

            "title": "Data Types",
            "content": "Data Types in Java . Before discussing Data Structures it is important to review Data Types and the AP Methods and Control Structures topic. To begin this discussion I asked ChatGPT, &quot;what are Java data types&quot; and was really happy with the answer ... . In Java, data types are used to define the type of data that a variable can hold. There are two main categories of data types in Java: primitive data types and reference data types. . Primitive data types: . byte: 8-bit signed integer (-128 to 127) | short: 16-bit signed integer (-32,768 to 32,767) | int: 32-bit signed integer (-2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647) | long: 64-bit signed integer (-9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807) | float: 32-bit floating-point number (1.4e-45 to 3.4e+38) | double: 64-bit floating-point number (4.9e-324 to 1.8e+308) | boolean: true or false | char: 16-bit Unicode character (0 to 65,535) | . | Reference data types: . Objects: instances of classes | Arrays: a collection of data of the same type. | . | . | Primitive data types are stored directly in memory, whereas reference data types are stored as a reference to a memory location where the actual data is stored. . | . This led to follow up question, &quot;what about Java Wrapper data types&quot; and this answer even corrected my language to say wrapper classes ... . Java Wrapper classes are classes that provide a way to use primitive data types as objects. They are called wrapper classes because they &quot;wrap&quot; the primitive data types into an object. . There are eight wrapper classes in Java, each corresponding to one of the primitive data types: | Byte: represents a byte value | Short: represents a short value | Integer: represents an int value | Long: represents a long value | Float: represents a float value | Double: represents a double value | Boolean: represents a boolean value | Character: represents a char value | . | . . Wrapper classes are often used when working with collections or other APIs that require objects rather than primitive data types. They also provide methods for converting between primitive data types and their corresponding object types, as well as methods for performing operations on the wrapped values. | . As an addendum to ChatGPT definition of a Wrapper Class, it is critical to understand assignments. When you assign a value to a wrapper class object, Java automatically creates a new instance of the wrapper class and assigns the value to it. Thus, every assignment is a new object!!! This process is called Auto-boxing. For example, to assign an integer value to an Integer object ... . // Both of these create new objects Integer n = 5; // Auto-boxing, Integer n = new Integer(5); n += 5; // Auto-boxing, Integer n = new Integer(n + 5); . For clarification, for my students I asked, &quot;define reference data types&quot;. This added a purpose to the name reference ... . In Java, reference data types are data types that hold references or memory addresses that point to objects. These data types do not actually contain the data they refer to, but instead, store a reference to the memory location where the data is stored. Area in blue is called stack, variables local to the method; area in green is called heap or area used to store objects. | . . Reference data types are used to store complex data structures such as objects and arrays. Objects are instances of classes that encapsulate data and behavior, while arrays are collections of data of the same type. . | When a reference data type variable is declared, memory is allocated for the reference variable itself, but not for the object or array it refers to. Memory for the object or array is allocated separately using the &quot;new&quot; keyword, and the reference variable is assigned the memory address of the object or array. . | *Reference data types are passed by reference, which means that when a reference variable is passed as a method argument, the method receives a copy of the reference, but both the original reference and the copy point to the same object in memory. This allows methods to modify the object or array that the reference points to***. . | . For completeness on this discussion I asked, &quot;define primitive data types&quot; ... . In Java, primitive data types are the basic building blocks of data that can hold a single value of a specific type. They are called &quot;primitive&quot; because they are not objects and do not have any methods or properties like objects do. . | There are eight primitive data types in Java: . byte: 8-bit signed integer (-128 to 127) | short: 16-bit signed integer (-32,768 to 32,767) | int: 32-bit signed integer (-2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647) | long: 64-bit signed integer (-9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807) | float: 32-bit floating-point number | double: 64-bit floating-point number | boolean: true or false | char: 16-bit Unicode character (0 to 65,535) | . | Primitive data types are stored directly in memory and are passed by value, which means that when a primitive data type variable is passed as a method argument, the method receives a copy of the value, not a reference to the original variable. This also means that modifying the value of a primitive data type variable inside a method does not affect the original value of the variable outside the method. . | . Data Types behaviors . The AP exam will have questions about &quot;primitives&quot;, &quot;wrapper classes&quot;, and &quot;reference&quot; and how they work in relation to &quot;pass by value&quot;, and &quot;pass by reference&quot;. . A primitive Data Type &quot;int&quot; showing pass by value . The primitive int data type. This code shows behavior as it is passed to method and the value is changed. . public class IntByValue { public static void changeInt(int n) { System.out.println(&quot;In changeInt method&quot;); System.out.println(&quot; tBefore n += 10: n = &quot; + n); // prints 5 n = n += 10; System.out.println(&quot; tAfter n += 10: n = &quot; + n); // prints 10 } public static void main(String[] args) { int n = 5; System.out.println(&quot;Main method before changeInt(n): n = &quot; + n); // prints 5 changeInt(n); System.out.println(&quot;Main method after changeInt(n): n = &quot; + n); // still prints 5 } } IntByValue.main(null); . The wrapper Integer class (by value or reference?) . An object wrapper class Integer for the primitive int data type. TWhen an Integer object is passed as a parameter to a method, the object is passed as a class. How does assignment behave in this example? By value or by reference? Observe the hashCode(), we will compare it to the next example. . public class IntegerByValueOrReference { public static void changeInteger(Integer n) { System.out.println(&quot;In changeInteger method&quot;); System.out.println(&quot; tBefore change: n = &quot; + n + // prints 5 &quot; hash code = &quot; + n.hashCode()); n += 10; // behind the scenes, this is: n = new Integer(n+10) System.out.println(&quot; tAfter change: n = &quot; + n + // prints 15 &quot; hash code = &quot; + n.hashCode()); } public static void main(String[] args) { Integer n = 5; System.out.println(&quot;Main method before changeInteger(n): n = &quot; + n + // prints 5 &quot; hash code = &quot; + n.hashCode()); changeInteger(n); System.out.println(&quot;Main method after changeInteger(n): n = &quot; + n + // now prints 15 &quot; hash code = &quot; + n.hashCode()); } } IntegerByValueOrReference.main(null); . The class AtomicInteger . A class AtomicInteger for the primitive int data type. When an AtomicInteger object is passed as a parameter to a method, the object is passed as a Java class. The only way to change the data with a class is to use the setters and getters of the Object. The hashCode() show a unique object number and it maintains consistency through as the referenced data being changed by the setter. . import java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicInteger; public class PassByReference { public static void changeAtomicInteger(AtomicInteger n) { System.out.println(&quot;In changeAtomicInteger method&quot;); System.out.println(&quot; tBefore change: n = &quot; + n + // prints 5 &quot; hash code = &quot; + n.hashCode()); n.set(n.get() + 10); // at this point, we are clearly working with reference data type System.out.println(&quot; tAfter change: n = &quot; + n + // prints 15 &quot; hash code = &quot; + n.hashCode()); } public static void main(String[] args) { AtomicInteger n = new AtomicInteger(5); // unlike conventional wrapper class, this requires new System.out.println(&quot;Main method before changeAtomicInteger(n): n = &quot; + n + // prints 5 &quot; hash code = &quot; + n.hashCode()); changeAtomicInteger(n); System.out.println(&quot;Main method after changeAtomicInteger(n): n = &quot; + n + // now prints 15 &quot; hash code = &quot; + n.hashCode()); } } PassByReference.main(null); . Swap by IntByReference . Behind the scenes you need to swap values. This add a little purpose by only swapping if values are out of LowHigh order. This is a Methods and Control Structures type of problem!!! . What are some elements in this Class that are important to AP CSA exam? Add a Setter to this Class and make modifications to code. . public class IntByReference { private int value; public IntByReference(Integer value) { this.value = value; } public String toString() { return (String.format(&quot;%d&quot;, this.value)); } public void swapToLowHighOrder(IntByReference i) { if (this.value &gt; i.value) { int tmp = this.value; this.value = i.value; i.value = tmp; } } public static void swapper(int n0, int n1) { IntByReference a = new IntByReference(n0); IntByReference b = new IntByReference(n1); System.out.println(&quot;Before: &quot; + a + &quot; &quot; + b); a.swapToLowHighOrder(b); // conditionally build swap method to change values of a, b System.out.println(&quot;After: &quot; + a + &quot; &quot; + b); System.out.println(); } public static void main(String[] ags) { IntByReference.swapper(21, 16); IntByReference.swapper(16, 21); IntByReference.swapper(16, -1); } } IntByReference.main(null); .

            "content": "Spring Security using Java Web Tokens Competition . JWT Hello Articles | . JWT concepts via ChatGPT with added illustrations . JSON Web Token (JWT) is a popular way to authenticate users in a web application. It is a compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties. The claims in a JWT are encoded as a JSON object that is digitally signed using JSON Web Signature (JWS). Here is an example of how you might use JWT for authentication in a JavaScript application: . The client sends a login request to the server with the user’s credentials (e.g., username and password). Client/Origin: https://nighthawkcoders.github.io | Server/Host: spring.nighthawkcodingsociety.com | . | If the credentials are valid, the server generates a JWT and sends it back to the client. Here ae some sample credentials. Sec-Fetch-Mode: cors | Sec-Fetch-Site: cross-site | . | The client stores the JWT in a cookie. Here is cookie in Chrome Inspect properties | . | For subsequent requests, the client sends the JWT in the Authorization header. Here is a sample JWT. jwt=eyJhbGciOiJIUzUxMiJ9.eyJzdWIiOiJqbTEwMjFAZ21haWwuY29tIiwiZXhwIjoxNjc1ODA0MTg2LCJpYXQiOjE2NzU3ODYxODZ9.rHoLxTcBJOBv36gH5qNI1VhgGv2Jub1OPtpddf1-fHd84BcL5MeGxiBhi2M0MpEJcuhTjeC2TYWVaOjT7ek0tg; Path=/; Max-Age=3600; Expires=Tue, 07 Feb 2023 17:09:46 GMT; Secure; HttpOnly; SameSite=None; Secure | . | The server verifies the JWT and, if it is valid, allows the request to proceed. Here is successful response. | . | The JWT consists of three parts, separated by dots (.). The first part is the header, which specifies the algorithm used to sign the JWT (e.g., HS256). The second part is the payload, which contains the claims. The third part is the signature, which is used to verify that the sender of the JWT is who it claims to be and to ensure that the message wasn’t changed along the way. . It is important to use HTTPS when transmitting JWTs to ensure that the JWT is not intercepted by an attacker. It is also a good idea to use short-lived JWTs (e.g., with an expiration time of one hour) and to refresh them frequently to reduce the risk of unauthorized access. . Storing JWT . There are a few different options for storing a JWT in a JavaScript application: . Cookies: You can store the JWT in a cookie and send it back to the server with each request. This is a simple and widely-supported option, but it has some limitations. For example, you can’t access cookies from JavaScript on a different domain, and some users may have cookies disabled in their browser settings. | Local storage: You can store the JWT in the browser’s local storage (localStorage) or session storage (sessionStorage). This option allows you to access the JWT from JavaScript on the same domain, but it is vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, where an attacker can inject malicious code into your application and steal the JWT from the storage. | HttpOnly cookie: You can store the JWT in an HttpOnly cookie, which is a cookie that can only be accessed by the server and not by client-side JavaScript. This option provides some protection against XSS attacks, but it is still vulnerable to other types of attacks, such as cross-site request forgery (CSRF). | ChatGPT says … It is generally recommended to use a combination of options to provide the best security for your application. For example, you could store the JWT in an HttpOnly cookie and also in local storage, and use JavaScript to send the JWT from local storage to the server with each request. This way, you can still access the JWT from JavaScript on the same domain, while also protecting against XSS attacks. . However, for this implementation we have used ** #3 HttpOnly Cookie **. . Key Configuration Areas . Nginx configuration snippet (Client to this Server): . Nginx. Focus on add_header in preflight that allow cross domain (github.io) to access server. java location / { proxy_pass http://localhost:8085; . # Preflighted requests if ($request_method = OPTIONS ) { add_header &quot;Access-Control-Allow-Credentials&quot; &quot;true&quot;; add_header &quot;Access-Control-Allow-Origin&quot; &quot;https://myserver.github.io&quot;; add_header &quot;Access-Control-Allow-Methods&quot; &quot;GET, POST, OPTIONS, HEAD&quot;; add_header &quot;Access-Control-Allow-MaxAge&quot; 600; add_header &quot;Access-Control-Allow-Headers&quot; &quot;Content-Type, Authorization, x-csrf-token&quot;; return 200; } } . Java JWT / Authenticate API . Java. Focus on the response ResponseCookie to see type, path, age, and allowing for cross-origin (sameSite). . @PostMapping(&quot;/authenticate&quot;) public ResponseEntity&lt;?&gt; createAuthenticationToken(@RequestBody Person authenticationRequest) throws Exception { authenticate(authenticationRequest.getEmail(), authenticationRequest.getPassword()); final UserDetails userDetails = personDetailsService .loadUserByUsername(authenticationRequest.getEmail()); final String token = jwtTokenUtil.generateToken(userDetails); final ResponseCookie tokenCookie = ResponseCookie.from(&quot;jwt&quot;, token) .httpOnly(true) .secure(true) .path(&quot;/&quot;) .maxAge(3600) .sameSite(&quot;None; Secure&quot;) // .domain(&quot;example.com&quot;) // Set to backend domain .build(); return ResponseEntity.ok().header(HttpHeaders.SET_COOKIE, tokenCookie.toString()).build(); } .

Focus on allowedOrigins, clients that can access this server server . @Override public void addCorsMappings(CorsRegistry registry) { registry.addMapping(&quot;/**&quot;).allowedOrigins(&quot;https://myserver.github.io&quot;, &quot;http://localhost:4000&quot;); } .

Authenticate with JWT in a JavaScript application: . This example sends a POST request to the /authorize endpoint with the user’s credentials in the request body. If the login was successful, the server will return a 200 OK response with the JWT set to Application properties. . /// URL for deployment var url = &quot;https://spring.nighthawkcodingsociety.com&quot; // Comment out next line for local testing // url = &quot;http://localhost:8085&quot; // Authenticate endpoint const login_url = url + &#39;/authenticate&#39;; function login_user(){ // Set body to include login data const body = { email: document.getElementById(&quot;uid&quot;).value, password: document.getElementById(&quot;password&quot;).value, }; // Set Headers to support cross origin const requestOptions = { method: &#39;POST&#39;, mode: &#39;cors&#39;, // no-cors, *cors, same-origin cache: &#39;no-cache&#39;, // *default, no-cache, reload, force-cache, only-if-cached credentials: &#39;include&#39;, // include, *same-origin, omit body: JSON.stringify(body), headers: { &quot;content-type&quot;: &quot;application/json&quot;, }, }; // Fetch JWT fetch(login_url, requestOptions) .then(response =&gt; { // trap error response from Web API if (!response.ok) { const errorMsg = &#39;Login error: &#39; + response.status; console.log(errorMsg); return; } // Success!!! // Redirect to Database location window.location.href = &quot;/APCSA/data/database&quot;; }) } . You can then use the JWT for authentication in subsequent fetch requests as the browser sends JWT in the Authorization header. Here is an example, but there is ** Nothing Unique ** in this example. . // prepare HTML result container for new output const resultContainer = document.getElementById(&quot;result&quot;); // prepare URL var url = &quot;https://spring.nighthawkcodingsociety.com/api/person/&quot;; // Uncomment next line for localhost testing // url = &quot;http://localhost:8085/api/person/&quot;; // set options for cross origin header request const options = { method: &#39;GET&#39;, // *GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc. mode: &#39;cors&#39;, // no-cors, *cors, same-origin cache: &#39;default&#39;, // *default, no-cache, reload, force-cache, only-if-cached credentials: &#39;include&#39;, // include, *same-origin, omit headers: { &#39;Content-Type&#39;: &#39;application/json&#39;, }, }; // fetch the API fetch(url, options) // response is a RESTful &quot;promise&quot; on any successful fetch .then(response =&gt; { // check for response errors and display if (response.status !== 200) { const errorMsg = &#39;Database response error: &#39; + response.status; console.log(errorMsg); const tr = document.createElement(&quot;tr&quot;); const td = document.createElement(&quot;td&quot;); td.innerHTML = errorMsg; tr.appendChild(td); resultContainer.appendChild(tr); return; } // valid response will contain json data response.json().then(data =&gt; { console.log(data); for (const row of data) { // tr and td build out for each row const tr = document.createElement(&quot;tr&quot;); const name = document.createElement(&quot;td&quot;); const id = document.createElement(&quot;td&quot;); const age = document.createElement(&quot;td&quot;); // data is specific to the API name.innerHTML = row.name; id.innerHTML = row.email; age.innerHTML = row.age; // this build td&#39;s into tr tr.appendChild(name); tr.appendChild(id); tr.appendChild(age); // add HTML to container resultContainer.appendChild(tr); } }) }) // catch fetch errors (ie ACCESS to server blocked) .catch(err =&gt; { console.error(err); const tr = document.createElement(&quot;tr&quot;); const td = document.createElement(&quot;td&quot;); td.innerHTML = err + &quot;: &quot; + url; tr.appendChild(td); resultContainer.appendChild(tr); }); . Hacks . This is first time that a nighthawkcoding society apps are under JWT. There are some best practices, but these are simply preliminary thoughts. These can be done in your project or on mine. . GitHub Pages Application Make a Login and SignUp option in upper left corner of page. To handle this well it may require some them adjustment. Login or Name should alway be displayed in upper right corner, review csa.nighthawkcodingsociety.com for example. | Only block or present login/signup page when someone fails on a fetch of something that is unauthorized. | . | Spring Application Add Roles to authentication | Bring JavaScript or Spring/Thymeleaf Admin operations into this page.

It is possible to do this either way, white list authenticated .antMatchers(&quot;/api/person/**&quot;).authenticated() or white list permitted .antMatchers(&quot;/&quot;, &quot;/frontend/**&quot;).permitAll(). In either case, it is valuable to have a convention on naming endpoints to simplify rules. | . | . /* * To enable HTTP Security in Spring, extend the WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter. */ @Configuration @EnableWebSecurity // Beans to enable basic Web security @EnableGlobalMethodSecurity(prePostEnabled = true) public class SecurityConfig extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter { @Autowired private JwtAuthenticationEntryPoint jwtAuthenticationEntryPoint; @Autowired private JwtRequestFilter jwtRequestFilter; @Autowired private PersonDetailsService personDetailsService; @Bean // Sets up password encoding style PasswordEncoder passwordEncoder(){ return new BCryptPasswordEncoder(); } @Autowired public void configureGlobal(AuthenticationManagerBuilder auth) throws Exception { // configure AuthenticationManager so that it knows from where to load // user for matching credentials // Use BCryptPasswordEncoder auth.userDetailsService(personDetailsService).passwordEncoder(passwordEncoder()); } @Override @Bean public AuthenticationManager authenticationManagerBean() throws Exception { return super.authenticationManagerBean(); } ... } . mvc person PersonDetailsService.java, implements UserDetailsService from JWT.

            "title": "JWT Tokens Implementation",
            "content": "The Code . JWT | SecurityConfig | . Simple Explanation of each java file . A majority of the code was taken from https://www.javainuse.com/spring/boot-jwt. The new dependencies we need is in this Commit. This site provided the basic code needed to generate a jwt token and how we would configure the backend to require authorization when accessing a page. (Commit1 &amp; Commit2). . JwtTokenUtil.java, just like its name, contains utilities/functions that is needed to generate JWT tokens and get information like the email from the JWT tokens which is needed for making sure the JWT token is valid. . JWTUserDetailsService.java implements the Spring Security UserDetailsService interface and overrides the loadUserByUsername so we can later get user details from the database using the username. . The name JwtAuthenticationController.java on the article was changed to JwtApiController.java to fit the already existing API controllers and this creates an API endpoint of /authenticate which validates that the given email and password in the body is validate and then generates a JWT token for the credentials if it was valid. . We did not need the JwtRequest.java because it is used to store each user as an object and that is the Person class we’ve already coded. We also do not need JwtResponse.java. . The JwtRequestFilter.java extends the Spring Web Filter OncePerRequestFilter class and overrides the doFilterInternal function so each request sent to the server is processed through the function. The function checks if the JWT token is valid and sets the Authentication in the context to specify that the current user is authenticated. . JwtAuthenticationEntryPoint.java implements AuthenticationEntryPoint and overrides the commence function to specify what to do when a user was not authenticated, which is to return an unauthorized error. . WebSecurityConfig.java is our existing SecurityConfig.java. It extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter and overrides configure to allow /authenticate to not need the request be authenticated because /authenticate is where you generate the JWT token is get authenticated, add the jwtRequestFilter.java filter to validate the token with every request, and configure other features of web security like a stateless session. This can also be used to allow specific roles when that is configured (as seen in last year’s csa project). . Bigger changes differing from the article . JWTUserDetailsService.java was changed from the article because we already have a database storing users while the article hardcoded a user and password because it did not. . In the article, it assumed that our passwords stored inside the database was already encrypted using bcrypt, therefore, we have to configure /post to encrypt the passwords when adding users (Commit). . Since the article coded for /authenticate to return the JWT token inside its body, the frontend would have to take the JWT token and configure it into the browser. This would be susceptible to Cross Site Scripting Attacks. We can avoid forcing the frontend’s javascript to set the cookie by coding for /authenticate api’s response to automatically set the browser’s cookies with the JWT token using the Set-Cookie header. For this part, I followed along with https://reflectoring.io/spring-boot-cookies/ and made some changes to JwtApiController.java. Now the request sent by the browser would contain the JWT token using a HttpOnly cookie, so we have to code JwtRequestFilter.java so it gets the JWT token from the request’s Cookie header instead of its Authorization header (Commit). . Testing . Postman Testing . Using the existing account’s credentials test2@gmail.com and test2 to generate JWT Token through /authenticate. . Trying to access /api/person/ without jwt token stored in Cookies . Trying to access /api/person/ with a wrong jwt token stored in Cookies . Trying to access /api/person/ with a jwt token that does not have the signature . Accessing /api/person/ with generated jwt token stored in Cookies header . Testing the use of cookies in Chrome console . At first, when you access http://localhost:8085/, it will return a 401 Unauthorized error because you do not have a jwt cookie. We can use Chrome console with fetch to model what a frontend would do, set data = {email:&quot;toby@gmail.com&quot;, password:&quot;123Toby!&quot;}; then fetch(&quot;http://localhost:8085/authenticate&quot;, {method: &#39;POST&#39;, headers: {&#39;Content-Type&#39;: &#39;application/json&#39;}, body: JSON.stringify(data)});: Notice how we have a jwt cookie now Reload and http://localhost:8085/ should load without 401 error . What’s next . Roles can also be implemented next based on the old csa project and an actual frontend would be great. .",

            "title": "Spring Security and Roles",
            "content": "Security Concepts . Last year Teacher spent time in Spring Security System for csa.nighthawkcodingsociety.com. The implementation allows users (Person POJO) to login with specific roles (Role POJO). Two roles are present currently, ROLE_ADMIN and ROLE_STUDENT. In this implementation the ROLE_STUDENT is NOT able to delete users, you must be ROLE_ADMIN to perform this task. . Teacher took inspiration form YouTube. This video covers the detail shared below in about 2 hours. . My issue with this starter code is I never had time to get to JWT and do not have a true web implementation. Some thoughts the Teacher has on that topic are in JWT tech talk, most of the info is courtesy of ChatGPT. . Main Ideas . Spring Security Code is focused in these areas: Database Folder, Security Folder, Login Page and Navbar fragment. . Backend - Using Spring Security to Protect Defining POJOs | Back End Spring Security Overrides to use Person and Role POJOs | Authentication (LOGIN), requiring login to access certain parts of site | Authorization (ROLE), differentiation of permission of ROLE_ADMIN and ROLE_ADMIN on | Training Spring Security to work with POJOs and Security Config | . | Frontend - Building Configuration and Overrides to support Spring Security Login Page (customizing your own) | Navbar with Control Login/Logout buttons | Error Page for 403 authorization failure | . | . Backend - Using Spring Security to Protect . The key work of the backend and Spring Security is to associate user (Person) and their (Roles) with access to Get and Post Mappings. Planning needs to go into your POJO to have role(s) associated with each person. . Person POJO with roles. . Observe Many to Many and role collection. . @Entity public class Person { // automatic unique identifier for Person record @Id @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.AUTO) private Long id; // email, password, roles are key to login and authentication @NotEmpty @Size(min=5) @Column(unique=true) @Email private String email; @NotEmpty private String password; // roles are stored in a &quot;related&quot; table @ManyToMany(fetch = EAGER) private Collection&lt;Role&gt; roles = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;(); ... } . Role POJO. . Contains String to store ROLE_ADMIN, ROLE_STUDENT as distinct rows. All users have ability to obtain the same roles as known by the system. . @Entity public class Role { @Id @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.AUTO) private Long id; @Column(unique=true) private String name; } . ###vBack End Code - Authentication and Authorization . SecurityConfig provided through Spring Security enables developer to Authorize and Authentication different portions of the site based on Login and Roles. Additionally, you are able to direct the next page on operations like login and logout. Review .antmatchers statements. This file is being established to support http for both Web viewing and API access. . protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception { //THis is going to be altered to use the JWT // security rules http .authorizeRequests() .antMatchers(POST, &quot;/api/person/post/**&quot;).hasAnyAuthority(&quot;ROLE_STUDENT&quot;) .antMatchers(DELETE, &quot;/api/person/delete/**&quot;).hasAnyAuthority(&quot;ROLE_ADMIN&quot;) .antMatchers(&quot;/database/personupdate/**&quot;).hasAnyAuthority(&quot;ROLE_STUDENT&quot;) .antMatchers(&quot;/database/persondelete/**&quot;).hasAnyAuthority(&quot;ROLE_ADMIN&quot;) .antMatchers( &quot;/api/person/**&quot;).permitAll() .antMatchers( &quot;/api/refresh/token/**&quot;).permitAll() .antMatchers(&quot;/&quot;, &quot;/starters/**&quot;, &quot;/frontend/**&quot;, &quot;/mvc/**&quot;, &quot;/database/person/**&quot;, &quot;/database/personcreate&quot;, &quot;/database/scrum/**&quot;, &quot;/course/**&quot;).permitAll() .anyRequest().authenticated() .and() .formLogin() .loginPage(&quot;/login&quot;) .permitAll() .and() .logout() .logoutRequestMatcher(new AntPathRequestMatcher(&quot;/logout&quot;)) .logoutSuccessUrl(&quot;/database/person&quot;) .permitAll() ; // Cross-Site Request Forgery needs to be disabled to allow activation of JS Fetch URIs http.csrf().disable(); } . Backend Code - Training Spring Security to work with POJO and Security Config . ModelRepo implements UserDetailsService. This associates user (Person) and roles (Role) with Spring Security as you can see with return values from method. . public class ModelRepository implements UserDetailsService . /* UserDetailsService Overrides and maps Person &amp; Roles POJO into Spring Security */ @Override public org.springframework.security.core.userdetails.UserDetails loadUserByUsername(String email) throws UsernameNotFoundException { Person person = personJpaRepository.findByEmail(email); // setting variable user equal to the method finding the username in the database if(person==null){ throw new UsernameNotFoundException(&quot;User not found in database&quot;); } Collection&lt;SimpleGrantedAuthority&gt; authorities = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;(); person.getRoles().forEach(role -&gt; { //loop through roles authorities.add(new SimpleGrantedAuthority(role.getName())); //create a SimpleGrantedAuthority by passed in role, adding it all to the authorities list, list of roles gets past in for spring security }); return new org.springframework.security.core.userdetails.User(person.getEmail(), person.getPassword(), authorities); } . Password Encryption. (BCrypt) is also managed with this file . // Setup Password style for Database storing and lookup @Autowired // Inject PasswordEncoder private PasswordEncoder passwordEncoder; @Bean // Sets up password encoding style PasswordEncoder passwordEncoder(){ return new BCryptPasswordEncoder(); } . Password is encoded before JPA save. Spring Security does decoding within its system, later we will build login to send user and password to Spring Security. . public void save(Person person) { person.setPassword(passwordEncoder.encode(person.getPassword())); personJpaRepository.save(person); } . Frontend - Building Configuration and Overrides to support Spring Security . Login Page (customizing your own). If you override the form, it needs to be built returning a username and password. The override was setup in MvcConfig. The purpose of override is so it follows Style guideline from the site. . &lt;form name=&quot;f&quot; th:action=&quot;@{/login}&quot; method=&quot;POST&quot;&gt; &lt;table&gt; &lt;tr th:if=&quot;${param.error}&quot; class=&quot;alert alert-error&quot;&gt; Invalid username and password. &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;tr th:if=&quot;${param.logout}&quot; class=&quot;alert alert-success&quot;&gt; You have been logged out. &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;!-- &#39;email&#39; is mapped to &#39;username&#39; for Spring Security --&gt; &lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;&lt;label for=&quot;username&quot;&gt;Email&lt;/label&gt;&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt; &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;email&quot; id=&#39;username&#39; name=&quot;username&quot; size=&quot;20&quot; required&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt; &lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;&lt;label for=&quot;password&quot;&gt;Password&lt;/label&gt;&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt; &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;password&quot; id=&quot;password&quot; name=&quot;password&quot; size=&quot;20&quot; required&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt; &lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;submit&quot; value=&quot;Submit&quot;&gt;&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt; &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a th:href=&quot;@{/database/personcreate}&quot;&gt;Sign Up&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt; &lt;/table&gt; . Navbar Customizations. Using Thymeleaf and Spring Security the Navbar toggles between Login/Logout based off of Spring Security status. . &lt;!-- Login/Logout --&gt; &lt;th:block sec:authorize=&quot;isAnonymous()&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;px-3&quot;&gt; &lt;a th:href=&#39;@{/login}&#39; class=&quot;link-dark&quot;&gt;Login&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/th:block&gt; &lt;th:block sec:authorize=&quot;isAuthenticated()&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;px-3&quot;&gt; &lt;a th:href=&#39;@{/logout}&#39; class=&quot;link-dark&quot;&gt;Logout&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/th:block&gt; . Authorization error - 403. Following standard of 404 errors, a 403 page is inserted to provide better user experience versus Spring Boot error page. 403.html. Main purpose of this page is to direct the user back into the website with href. . &lt;div class=&quot;jumbotron jumbotron-fluid&quot; style=&quot;text-align: center; &quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;You don&#39;t have permission to do that! (Insufficient Role)&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;/&quot;&gt;Go Home&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; . Hacks . This blog should give you many considerations when considering how to design a login system with roles. There are many features to consider, specifically what elements of site will be used by users/roles. .

POJO - Define Note table and Many-to-One relationship . POJO is the foundation for table definition. Key NEW parts are described… . The @ManyToOne annotation establishes relationship between this Note record and Person to which it belongs. | The @Column(columnDefinition=”TEXT”) enables SQL to define this as a very large (Blob) style database type. This is not restricted in the database like a ordinary string. | FYI, @Data is shortcut, it is like having @Getter, @Setter, @ToString, @EqualsAndHashCode and @RequiredArgsConstructor annotations on the class. | . package com.nighthawk.csa.mvc.database.note; import com.nighthawk.csa.mvc.database.person.Person; import lombok.*; import javax.persistence.*; import javax.validation.constraints.NotNull; @Data @NoArgsConstructor @AllArgsConstructor @Entity public class Note { @Id @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.AUTO) private Long id; @ManyToOne @JoinColumn(name=&quot;person_id&quot;) private Person person; @NotNull @Column(columnDefinition=&quot;TEXT&quot;) private String text; } . JPA - Find all Notes with Person Object . This Class extends JPA which provides standard database queries. There is one additional method defined using JPA interface definitions, findAllByPerson which returns a List which is all notes for a Person. . package com.nighthawk.csa.mvc.database.note; import com.nighthawk.csa.mvc.database.person.Person; import com.nighthawk.csa.mvc.database.role.Role; import org.springframework.data.jpa.repository.JpaRepository; import java.util.List; public interface NoteJpaRepository extends JpaRepository&lt;Note, Long&gt; { List&lt;Note&gt; findAllByPerson(Person p); } . Controller - View Page . This Control method focuses on loading data for page. Key logic is shared… . This form needs to be called with valid id, this is achieved by loading through table | Person object is loaded through its id | List object is loaded with ***JPA query*** which takes a `Person object` as parameter | Note an object is prepared for Save operation in UI | Very important, the convertMarkdownToHTML method is built to change the saved text/markdown/html to HTML and has method “public static String convertMarkdownToHTML(String markdown)” and multiple import org.commonmark.* dependencies.

Controller - Save Note via JPA method . This Control method focuses on saving the Note. Key logic is shared… . After this method is done Error or Success, it needs to return to Notes page, the String redirect = “redirect:/database/notes/”+note.getPerson().getId() is to make sure it goes back to same Person | Note is saved via JPA: noteRepository.save(note); | . @PostMapping(&quot;/database/notes&quot;) public String notesAdd(@Valid Note note, BindingResult bindingResult) { // back to person ID on redirect String redirect = &quot;redirect:/database/notes/&quot;+note.getPerson().getId(); // database errors if (bindingResult.hasErrors()) { return redirect; } // note is saved and person ID is pre-set noteRepository.save(note); // Redirect to next step return redirect; } . Frontend - Form and Action for New Note . The Form is used for new Post/Blog. Here are key elements… . The form is bound using bound to the note object (see th:object=”${note}”). | It is critical to have th:field=”*{person.id}” hidden reference. This will link Note to Person in backend save. | The textarea is used for input to be more Note like. | . &lt;form class=&quot;form-inline&quot; action=&quot;#&quot; th:action=&quot;@{/database/notes}&quot; th:object=&quot;${note}&quot; method=&quot;POST&quot;&gt; &lt;table class=&quot;table&quot;&gt; &lt;thead&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;!-- avoid warnings on binding person.id line --&gt; &lt;label for=&quot;id&quot; hidden&gt;ID&lt;/label&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;th&gt;&lt;label for=&quot;text&quot;&gt;Create a new note:&lt;/label&gt;&lt;/th&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;/thead&gt; &lt;tbody&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;!-- everything fails without binding person.id --&gt; &lt;input type=&quot;number&quot; th:field=&quot;*{person.id}&quot; id=&quot;id&quot; hidden class=&quot;form-control-plaintext&quot; &gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;textarea rows = &quot;5&quot; cols = &quot;100%&quot; th:field=&quot;*{text}&quot; id=&quot;text&quot; required&gt;&lt;/textarea&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;submit&quot; value=&quot;Add&quot; &gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;/tbody&gt; &lt;/table&gt; &lt;/form&gt; . Frontend - Display Existing Notes . A table is used to display history of Post/Blog. Here are key elements… . The “notes” is received as a data source that is specific to the logged in User | Uses th:each to process each element in list | UI preference is these are in reverse order and array is used to process them backwards (choice is to handle this in frontend but it could be handled in JPA query as well. | Very import “th:utext” is used to make sure it is rendered HTML versus text-based HTML | . &lt;div class=&quot;table-responsive&quot;&gt; &lt;table class=&quot;table&quot;&gt; &lt;tbody&gt; &lt;!--Notes output area, Thymeleaf lines iterate through notes backwards, note.text is html converted from markdown requires th:utext to render correctly --&gt; &lt;tr th:each=&quot;i : ${#numbers.sequence(notes.size() - 1, 0, -1)}&quot; th:with=&quot;n=${notes[i]}&quot;&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;span th:utext=&quot;${n.text}&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;/tbody&gt; &lt;/table&gt; &lt;/div&gt; . Hacks . This blog adds to the concept of persistent data for a Person POJO. As it is focused on building a relational table for Notes to Person. Notes supports text/markdown/html rendering. Annotations and Hibernate are used. Explore and build other options for your tables and relationships. FYI, there is even inheritance in POJOs. You will learn a lot about Java if you explore with true PBL mindset. .

Also, try build a table with json data versus fetching data. | Issues should discuss problems/challenges, in Teacher/Student data here are a couple ... This design will have many JavaScript actions, at least one for each CRUD operation. In this design, developer needs think of JavaScript functions to replace placeholder alerts in example code above. | There can be different roles for CRUD operations. For instance, student will only interact with their own account. Teacher may interact with many accounts. | Given these CRUD operations what kind of APIs are needed? They should map closely button/on click actions, as each action will fetch or manipulate data differently. | . | . Extra Credit.

SASS helps process a SASS file and compile it like the usual CSS file. Using SASS let’s us leverage off of a lot of implementation that has already been performed, such as GitHub pages. But it also lets you more programmatically build CSS. . . SASS Prerequisites . Skip downloads section unless you have issues. . Downloads / Command Prompt Lines . Check for npm --version to verify install, or download node.js here (just download the LTS version). . | This line of code is just used to check that you actually have npm installed, if not run installer : npm --version . | Next you will use check for sass : npm view sass version . | Install sass if required : npm install -g sass . | . SASS Tips . Features / Functionality . As the great thing about scss is that it writes the css for you, making it much less tedious. There are many aspects as to why it actually simplifies the process. | . Aspect 1: Partials . Sass naturally transpiles all the .scss files directly. However, when you want to import a file, you do not need the file to be transpiled directly. Sass has a mechanism for this: If you start the filename with an underscore, Sass will not transpile it. Files named this way are called partials and they allow you to work in a much more organized space. | . Aspect 2: Defining Colors / Variables . Rather than retyping the hexadecimal values of each color every single time, you can define all of the ones you want to use in a partial and then just reference them with $[color] when you want to use it. However, make sure you import the partial into the scss file where you are going to use it in. $light: #f7f7f7; $dark: #222121; $lime: #00cc66; $orangeRed: #fb4b4e; $blue: #2541b2; . | Example shown here: .navbar { background: $light; // see how instead of having to retype the hexadecimal, I can just reference it like this WOWOW so COOL height: 80px; display: flex; justify-content: space-between; padding: 0.5rem calc((100vw - 1200px) / 2); z-index: 10; position: relative; . | . Aspect 3: Nested Styling . Another unique aspect about scss is that you can actually nest styles, so if you want an aspect like let’s say color to apply to everything you are working on for that portion of the html, you can actually nest the rest of the formatting, animations, etc within that definition. | Implementation shown here with the Hero section in student scss: .hero { background-color: $light; // see how the rest of the code is indented / nested within .hero &amp;__container { display: grid; grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr; align-items: center; justify-items: center; margin: 0 auto; height: 90vh; z-index: 1; width: 100%; max-width: 1200px; padding-right: 24px; padding-left: 24px; @include tablet { // @include tablet and @include mobile will be explained next grid-template-columns: 1fr; height: 100%; } &amp;--left { width: 100%; line-height: 1.2; @include tablet { padding: 5rem 0; } @include mobile { line-height: 1.5; } } &amp;--left h1 { font-size: 4rem; color: $lime; @include mobile { font-size: 1.5rem; } } &amp;--left h2 { font-size: 4rem; color: $dark; @include mobile { font-size: 2rem; } } &amp;--left p { font-size: 2rem; color: $dark; margin-top: 1rem; font-weight: 700; @include mobile { font-size: 1.5rem; } } &amp;--btn { font-size: 1rem; background-color: $lime; padding: 14px 32px; border: none; border-radius: 4px; color: $light; margin-top: 2rem; cursor: pointer; position: relative; transition: all 0.3s; outline: none; } &amp;--btn a { position: relative; z-index: 2; color: $light; text-decoration: none; } &amp;--btn:after { // code animates home page button so that it transitions to red when hovered position: absolute; content: &#39;&#39;; top: 0; left: 0; width: 0; height: 100%; background: $orangeRed; transition: all 0.3s; border-radius: 4px; } &amp;--btn:hover:after { width: 100%; } &amp;--right { text-align: center; } &amp;--img { height: 100%; width: 100%; } } } . | You can see how this code works in tandem with the Hero section of the HTML, the class definitions are associated with every definition of styling coded above: | . &lt;!-- Hero HTML, each of the classes here correspond to what&#39;s defined above in the scss &lt;div class=&quot;hero&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;hero__container&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;hero__container--left&quot;&gt; &lt;h1&gt;College Apps Are Coming!&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Be Prepared&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sign up now to join the list.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;button class=&quot;hero__container--btn&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#&quot;&gt;Sign Up&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/button&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;hero__container--right&quot;&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;images/img-2.svg&quot; class=&quot;hero__container--img&quot; /&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; --&gt; . Aspect 4: Easily Change Formatting Based on Device . With the power of scss, you can more easily than ever change the formatting of your site based on which device a person is using. | Such can be done by defining the resolutions in a partial like here: | . &lt;!-- @mixin tablet { @media screen and (max-width: 768px) { @content; } } @mixin mobile { @media screen and (max-width: 280px) { @content; } } --&gt; . Then you can use @include to reference these resolutions and change the css/formatting based on the device like here: | . &amp;--left h1 { font-size: 4rem; color: $lime; @include mobile { // in this case the font size changes because it&#39;s mobile font-size: 1.5rem; } } &amp;--left h2 { font-size: 4rem; color: $dark; @include mobile { font-size: 2rem; } } . Aspect 5: Extending, Inheritance, and Calculations . In scss, you can also use @extend if you want certain classes to inherit attributes from previously defined classes, sort of similar to nesting inheritance (where the classes nested within inherit the attributes from outermost classes). An example is shown below: | . &lt;!-- %align-center { display: flex; align-items: center; } logo { color: $dark; cursor: pointer; text-decoration: none; font-size: 2rem; margin-left: 24px; @extend %align-center; //it&#39;s inheriting the above values for display and align:items } --&gt; . Furthermore, you can actually use math operators like multiplication, addition, subtraction and division in scss. In the code below I use it to extend the animation of a button: &amp;--btn:hover:after { width: 100% * 4; //makes the animation extend way farther, past the border of the button } . | .

Jobs . Quality 1st and Creativity/Features 2nd will be the keys to 2nd Trimester points. Each team role needs to establish goals. To improve software it is important that all parties in the project have full understanding of requirements through fluid communication channels. Thus, establishing a development plan is a requirement. Here are some ideas … . Feature Focus keep an up to date blog/readme on the features of your project. The focus is to have 4 to 5 major features and the team should keep an up to date status of the progress of those features. This includes how each feature meets all the criteria of College Board Create Task. | Scrum Master should have Team Member Issues and Customer/Teacher/Grader review ticket always in plan. The review ticket should line up with Quality and Feature Focus. Scrum Master maintain features/quality plan and holds team members accountable to plan. Think about Scrum Board, README, and Issues as key artifacts to plan. | DevOps should have CI/CD goals. Process should be able to identify failures when the occur and by what change. | Backend Developer should have tester methods that don’t depend on Frontend code or later CI/CD process to catch errors. Make sure key features are working in backend. | Frontend Developer should establish full system checks before reviews. Don’t be that guy that says, “it worked last time I tried it”. All system checks should be able to be performed on localhost frontend server. | . End with Comment Edits . Every person should modify their comment. .

Sahill class of &#39;23 discussion... For 2019 FRQ4, one idea I had was maybe turning each light into an object, since right now each element of the 2D array is simply a Boolean. Each light can have Boolean property for off/on, but also additional method to turn on the light (this would be the same as a setter, but it is more abstracted and cleaner in my opinion). An interesting idea could be to have a luminosity property and a quality property. We can start off each light object with a certain luminosity, say 100, and then decrement this luminosity based on quality value. For example, if quality is 1, then the luminosity decreases by 1 every minute (if the light is on). We can then have an API endpoint that tracks the luminosity for each light. .

            "content": "Calculator . Helping a computer interpret a Mathematical expression is a derivation of FRQ3 that involves using ArrayLists, Stack, and Map. These are key data structures that exist in Java. To obtain a deeper understanding of ArrayList, or its List interface, it is to use it in many applications. . Operators and Precedence . To support mathematical expressions you need to define Unique List of operators that are supported by your Calculator. . // Helper definition to define operators, lookup in MAP are fast and easy O(1) versus ArrayList O(n) private final Map&lt;String, Integer&gt; OPERATORS = new HashMap&lt;&gt;(); { // Map&lt;&quot;token&quot;, precedence&gt; OPERATORS.put(&quot;*&quot;, 3); OPERATORS.put(&quot;/&quot;, 3); OPERATORS.put(&quot;%&quot;, 3); OPERATORS.put(&quot;+&quot;, 4); OPERATORS.put(&quot;-&quot;, 4); } . Organizing an Expression . To support terms in mathematical expression you need to define symbols (other than operators) that help delineate the elements of an expression. Ultimately, the String expression will be broken in distinct elements in a List, we will call each element a Token. . FRQ3 calls these delimiters. Many encoded strings contain delimiters. A delimiter is a non-empty string that acts as a boundary between different parts of a larger string. The delimiters involved in this question occur in pairs that must be balanced,with each pair having an open delimiter and a close delimiter. . | FRQ3 mentions expressions. Expressions in mathematics use open parentheses &quot;(&quot; and close parentheses &quot;)&quot; as delimiters. For each open parenthesis, there must be a matching close parenthesis. . (x + y) * 5 is a valid mathematical expression. | (x + (y) is NOT a valid mathematical expression because there are more open delimiters than close delimiters. | . | . // Helper definition for supported separators private final Map&lt;String, Integer&gt; SEPARATORS = new HashMap&lt;&gt;(); { // Map&lt;&quot;separator&quot;, not_used&gt; SEPARATORS.put(&quot; &quot;, 0); SEPARATORS.put(&quot;(&quot;, 0); SEPARATORS.put(&quot;)&quot;, 0); } . Expression Evaluation . To detect operators and separators in the String expression, requires test functions to detect the tokens. These methods will assist in establishing Control Flow in evaluating the expression. . // Test if token is an operator private boolean isOperator(String token) { // find the token in the hash map return OPERATORS.containsKey(token); } // Test if token is an separator private boolean isSeparator(String token) { // find the token in the hash map return SEPARATORS.containsKey(token); } // Compare precedence of operators. private Boolean isPrecedent(String token1, String token2) { // token 1 is precedent if it is greater than token 2 return (OPERATORS.get(token1) - OPERATORS.get(token2) &gt;= 0) ; } . Calculator Theory . Mathematical expression written by humans are in the form of a String Expression. Since this expression is simply a string to the computer... an algorithm is required to reform the equation for the computer to ensure it interprets expression according to the rules of mathematics. . In mathematics, an expression or mathematical expression is a finite combination of symbols that is well-formed (ie &quot;100 + 200&quot;). | In computers, a string expression is hard to calculate. Thus, the expression needs to be restructured according to rules of Mathematics that a computer can calculate. For instance, the order of precedence rules, aka PEMDAS (parenthesis, exponents, multiplication, division, addition, subtraction) need to be factored into order of computation. To support these rules, in computer math we often convert a String expression into Reverse Polish Notation (RPN). This converts a simple string like &quot;3 + 4&quot; to become [&quot;100&quot;, &quot;200&quot;, &quot;+&quot;]) using the Shunting-yard algorithm. | . String expression to calculation will need a flow of control. A Class (aka model) is defined with instance variables, one argument constructor, and a toString. In this code, the flow is in the Calculator calculation is contained in the constructor. . Capture original input | Parse expression into mathematical terms | If using Shunting-yard algorithm, place terms into RPN | Calculate RPN to a result | . // Key instance variables private final String expression; private ArrayList&lt;String&gt; tokens; private ArrayList&lt;String&gt; reverse_polish; private Double result; // Create a 1 argument constructor providing a mathematical expression public Calculator(String expression) { // original input this.expression = expression; // parse expression into terms this.termTokenizer(); // place terms into reverse polish notation this.tokensToReversePolishNotation(); // calculate reverse polish notation this.rpnToResult(); } // Print the expression, terms, and result public String toString() { return (&quot;Original expression: &quot; + this.expression + &quot; n&quot; + &quot;Tokenized expression: &quot; + this.tokens.toString() + &quot; n&quot; + &quot;Reverse Polish Notation: &quot; +this.reverse_polish.toString() + &quot; n&quot; + &quot;Final result: &quot; + String.format(&quot;%.2f&quot;, this.result)); } . Term Tokenizer . FRQ3 talks about changing terms to tokens. A string containing text and possibly delimiters has been split into tokens and stored in String[] tokens. Each token is either an open delimiter, a close delimiter, or a substring that is not a delimiter. You will write the method getDelimitersList, which returns an ArrayList containing all the open and close delimiters found in tokens in their original order. . - openDel:&quot;(&quot; - closeDel: &quot;)&quot; - tokens: &quot;(&quot; &quot;100 + 200&quot; &quot;)&quot; &quot; * 3&quot; - ArrayList of delimiters: &quot;(&quot; &quot;)&quot; . The method termTokenizer() is used to change the String expression into a series of tokens that constitute distinct elements of a Mathematical expression. The result is retained in the ArrayList &quot;tokens&quot;. Every token, including parenthesis, is an element in the &quot;tokens&quot; ArrayList. . - Example 1:Simple Math - Original expression: 100 + 200 * 3 - tokens ArrayList: [100, +, 200, *, 3] - Example 2: Parenthesis Math to change order of operations - Original expression: (100 + 200) * 3 - tokens ArrayList: [(, 100, +, 200, ), *, 3] . String to Tokens . Before Tokenizer there is a String. During tokenization the Chars of the String are made into mathematical tokens. . Simple Math String:&quot;100+2003&quot; - Tokens: &quot;100&quot;, &quot;+&quot;, &quot;200&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;3&quot; | . | . // Term Tokenizer takes original expression and converts it to ArrayList of tokens private void termTokenizer() { // contains final list of tokens this.tokens = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;(); int start = 0; // term split starting index StringBuilder multiCharTerm = new StringBuilder(); // term holder for (int i = 0; i &lt; this.expression.length(); i++) { Character c = this.expression.charAt(i); if ( isOperator(c.toString() ) || isSeperator(c.toString()) ) { // 1st check for working term and add if it exists if (multiCharTerm.length() &gt; 0) { tokens.add(this.expression.substring(start, i)); } // Add operator or parenthesis term to list if (c != &#39; &#39;) { tokens.add(c.toString()); } // Get ready for next term start = i + 1; multiCharTerm = new StringBuilder(); } else { // multi character terms: numbers, functions, perhaps non-supported elements // Add next character to working term multiCharTerm.append(c); } } // Add last term if (multiCharTerm.length() &gt; 0) { tokens.add(this.expression.substring(start)); } } . Tokens to RPN . Before calculation the tokens need to be turned into RPN. This puts math in left to right order and resolves order of operations. . Simple Math. Tokens:&quot;100&quot;, &quot;+&quot;, &quot;200&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;3&quot; - RPN: &quot;100&quot;, &quot;200&quot;, &quot;3&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;+&quot; | . | . Parenthesis Math. Note RPN difference Tokens: &quot;(&quot;, &quot;100}, &quot;+&quot;, &quot;200&quot;, &quot;)&quot;, &quot;*&quot;, &quot;3&quot; | RPN: &quot;100&quot;, &quot;200&quot;, &quot;+&quot;, &quot;3&quot;, &quot;*&quot; | . | . // Takes tokens and converts to Reverse Polish Notation (RPN). private void tokensToReversePolishNotation () { // contains final list of tokens in RPN List&lt;String&gt; reverse_polish = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;(); // stack is used to reorder for appropriate grouping and precedence Stack tokenStack = new Stack(); for (String token : tokens) { switch (token) { // If left bracket push token on to stack case &quot;(&quot;: tokenStack.push(token); break; case &quot;)&quot;: while (tokenStack.peek() != null &amp;&amp; !tokenStack.peek().equals(&quot;(&quot;)) { reverse_polish.add( (String)tokenStack.pop() ); } tokenStack.pop(); break; case &quot;+&quot;: case &quot;-&quot;: case &quot;*&quot;: case &quot;/&quot;: case &quot;%&quot;: // While stack // not empty AND stack top element // and is an operator while (tokenStack.peek() != null &amp;&amp; isOperator((String) tokenStack.peek())) { if ( isPrecedent(token, (String) tokenStack.peek() )) { reverse_polish.add((String)tokenStack.pop()); continue; } break; } // Push the new operator on the stack tokenStack.push(token); break; default: // Default should be a number, there could be test here this.reverse_polish.add(token); } } // Empty remaining tokens while (tokenStack.peek() != null) { reverse_polish.add((String)tokenStack.pop()); } } . RPN to Result . Below is setup/pseudo code to produce a result. This is opportunity to learn about a Stack, by adding and removing elements from the stack according to intermediate and final results. . During calculation algorithm will work through RPN, Left to Right. 1. go to first operator, 2. obtain to the amount of operands required for operator, 3. solve, 4. push result . Simple Math. . RPN:&quot;100&quot;, &quot;200&quot;, &quot;3&quot;, &quot;*&quot;, &quot;+&quot; - calcStack Step 1: [100] | calcStack Step 2 [200, 100] | calcStack Step 3 [3, 200, 100] | calcStack Step 4 [600, 100] | calcStack Step 5 [700] . result = 700 # final pop . | . | . // Takes RPN and produces a final result private void rpnToResult() { // stack is used to hold operands and each calculation Stack&lt;Double&gt; calcStack = new Stack&lt;Double&gt;(); // RPN is processed, ultimately calcStack has final result for (String token : this.reverse_polish) { // If the token is an operator, calculate if (isOperator(token)) { // Pop the two top entries // Calculate intermediate results result = 0.0; // Push intermediate result back onto the stack calcStack.push( result ); } // else the token is a number push it onto the stack else { calcStack.push(Double.valueOf(token)); } } // Pop final result and set as final result for expression this.result = calcStack.pop(); } . Driver / Tester . A Class should always have a driver for testing. In a driver for expressions, you will need to consider multiple conditions, for instance changes with precedence... . Output Examples . Here are sample outputs for the calculator . Simple Math Original expression:100 + 200 * 3Tokenized expression: [100, +, 200, *, 3] Reverse Polish Notation: [100, 200, 3, *, +] Final result: 700.00 Parenthesis Math Original expression: (100 + 200) * 3 Tokenized expression: [(, 100, +, 200, ), *, 3] Reverse Polish Notation: [100, 200, +, 3, *] Final result: 900.00 Decimal Math Original expression: 100.2 - 99.3 Tokenized expression: [100.2, -, 99.3] Reverse Polish Notation: [100.2, 99.3, -] Final result: 0.90 Modulo Math Original expression: 300 % 200 Tokenized expression: [300, %, 200] Reverse Polish Notation: [300, 200, %] Final result: 100.00 Division Math Original expression: 300/200 Tokenized expression: [300, /, 200] Reverse Polish Notation: [300, 200, /] Final result: 1.50 .

            "content": "Classes Background . All concepts in Classes FRQs can be used with POJOs in PBL. The 2019 FRQ #2 describes a problem of a Step Tracker. The task is to write a StepTracker class. Included is the constructor and any required instance variables and methods. . Constructor:StepTracker tr = new StepTracker(10000);- Get Methods with algorithms: tr.activeDays(); tr.averageSteps(); | Set Methods: tr.addDailySteps(9000); | . Assumptions to PBL this Project . This is a fun problem and could be expanded upon with PBL. The StepTracker could be a POJO in Java. As a PBL concept, StepTracking is something that is done by an individual in relation to their personal fitness. What designs or objects would you need for StepTracking... . Backend Assumptions:- This problem has one-to-many relationship between &quot;Person&quot; object to day &quot;steps&quot; attributes. - Each day &quot;steps&quot; attribute would need to be stored. . Active days implies a &quot;Person&quot; object needs a &quot;goal_steps&quot; attribute to be stored to compare against the &quot;steps&quot; attribute for a day. | Person Class. Contact and biographical information, like age/height/weight could be important to this application. Such information could be used to help calculate goals for &quot;steps&quot;. | Day statistics in Class could go beyond &quot;steps&quot;. Though &quot;steps&quot; is key element. Additional attributes could include walking or running time, calorie intake, sleep hours, mood ratio, or other factors that could help in determining goal versus accomplishments. | Other relationships. A daily collection of &quot;stats&quot; implies calculations for Month or Year. Investigation should be made to determine best Java Modeling and Algorithms available. | . | Frontend Assumptions: . A person&#39;s steps need to be recorded by a person in the Frontend | A person would need to view or perform analytics on self, perhaps a daily step chart. | A person might want to know about how they met or missed goals versus food calorie intake, hours slept, mood ratio. | . | . Starting the Project . To study Classes, which is the intent of FRQ2, A PBL project step tracking seems to begin with a &quot;Person&quot; Class. This may deviate from FRQ 2 simplicity, but it is a higher-level way to approach this problem. . Person POJO . This POJO is setup as an @Entity and use Lambok extensively to reduce code required by Developer(s). This POJO can be used for many Projects!!! . package com.nighthawk.spring_portfolio.mvc.person; import java.time.LocalDate; import java.time.Period; import java.time.ZoneId; import java.util.Date; import java.util.HashMap; import java.util.Map; import javax.persistence.Column; import javax.persistence.Entity; import javax.persistence.GeneratedValue; import javax.persistence.GenerationType; import javax.persistence.Id; import javax.validation.constraints.Email; import javax.validation.constraints.NotEmpty; import javax.validation.constraints.Size; import org.hibernate.annotations.Type; import org.hibernate.annotations.TypeDef; import org.springframework.format.annotation.DateTimeFormat; import com.vladmihalcea.hibernate.type.json.JsonType; import lombok.AllArgsConstructor; import lombok.Data; import lombok.NoArgsConstructor; import lombok.NonNull; /* Person is a POJO, Plain Old Java Object.

Next Steps . Building the Spring Java Persistent API (JPA) and the RestController API will get this or any other project off of the ground. The JPA works with the database and RestController enables access by the Frontend developers. . Spring Data JPA . The appeal of Java for me and the Computer Science industry is the ease of database management. Being able to define a POJO and get all the database management under the hood is very cool! . BTW, there is a task to change to AWS in the future, this can be done by changing application properties and and POM dependencies, with little or no change to code. | Review code, there are Long interfaces and native SQL options in extending interfaces into the JPA Repository. | . package com.nighthawk.spring_portfolio.mvc.person; import org.springframework.data.jpa.repository.JpaRepository; import org.springframework.data.jpa.repository.Query; import java.util.List; /* Extends the JpaRepository interface from Spring Data JPA. -- Java Persistent API (JPA) - Hibernate: map, store, update and retrieve database -- JpaRepository defines standard CRUD methods -- Via JPA the developer can retrieve database from relational databases to Java objects and vice versa. */ public interface PersonJpaRepository extends JpaRepository&lt;Person, Long&gt; { Person findByEmail(String email); List&lt;Person&gt; findAllByOrderByNameAsc(); // JPA query, findBy does JPA magic with &quot;Name&quot;, &quot;Containing&quot;, &quot;Or&quot;, &quot;Email&quot;, &quot;IgnoreCase&quot; List&lt;Person&gt; findByNameContainingIgnoreCaseOrEmailContainingIgnoreCase(String name, String email); /* Custom JPA query articles, there are articles that show custom SQL as well https://springframework.guru/spring-data-jpa-query/ https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/jpa/docs/current/reference/html/#jpa.query-methods */ // Custom JPA query @Query( value = &quot;SELECT * FROM Person p WHERE p.name LIKE ?1 or p.email LIKE ?1&quot;, nativeQuery = true) List&lt;Person&gt; findByLikeTermNative(String term); /* https://www.baeldung.com/spring-data-jpa-query */ } . Sprint RestController . This is the interface between Backend implementation and the world. Get, Post, Delete mappings are shown. In this code, you will see many interactions with the POJO as well as interactions with the JPA. . package com.nighthawk.spring_portfolio.mvc.person; import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired; import org.springframework.http.HttpStatus; import org.springframework.http.MediaType; import org.springframework.http.ResponseEntity; import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.*; import java.util.*; import java.text.SimpleDateFormat; @RestController @RequestMapping(&quot;/api/person&quot;) public class PersonApiController { /* #### RESTful API #### Resource: https://spring.io/guides/gs/rest-service/ */ // Autowired enables Control to connect POJO Object through JPA @Autowired private PersonJpaRepository repository; /* GET List of People */ @GetMapping(&quot;/&quot;) public ResponseEntity&lt;List&lt;Person&gt;&gt; getPeople() { return new ResponseEntity&lt;&gt;( repository.findAllByOrderByNameAsc(), HttpStatus.OK); } /* GET individual Person using ID */ @GetMapping(&quot;/{id}&quot;) public ResponseEntity&lt;Person&gt; getPerson(@PathVariable long id) { Optional&lt;Person&gt; optional = repository.findById(id); if (optional.isPresent()) { // Good ID Person person = optional.get(); // value from findByID return new ResponseEntity&lt;&gt;(person, HttpStatus.OK); // OK HTTP response: status code, headers, and body } // Bad ID return new ResponseEntity&lt;&gt;(HttpStatus.BAD_REQUEST); } /* DELETE individual Person using ID */ @DeleteMapping(&quot;/delete/{id}&quot;) public ResponseEntity&lt;Person&gt; deletePerson(@PathVariable long id) { Optional&lt;Person&gt; optional = repository.findById(id); if (optional.isPresent()) { // Good ID Person person = optional.get(); // value from findByID repository.deleteById(id); // value from findByID return new ResponseEntity&lt;&gt;(person, HttpStatus.OK); // OK HTTP response: status code, headers, and body } // Bad ID return new ResponseEntity&lt;&gt;(HttpStatus.BAD_REQUEST); } /* POST Aa record by Requesting Parameters from URI */ @PostMapping( &quot;/post&quot;) public ResponseEntity&lt;Object&gt; postPerson(@RequestParam(&quot;email&quot;) String email, @RequestParam(&quot;password&quot;) String password, @RequestParam(&quot;name&quot;) String name, @RequestParam(&quot;dob&quot;) String dobString) { Date dob; try { dob = new SimpleDateFormat(&quot;MM-dd-yyyy&quot;).parse(dobString); } catch (Exception e) { return new ResponseEntity&lt;&gt;(dobString +&quot; error; try MM-dd-yyyy&quot;, HttpStatus.BAD_REQUEST); } // A person object WITHOUT ID will create a new record with default roles as student Person person = new Person(email, password, name, dob); repository.save(person); return new ResponseEntity&lt;&gt;(email +&quot; is created successfully&quot;, HttpStatus.CREATED); } /* The personSearch API looks across database for partial match to term (k,v) passed by RequestEntity body */ @PostMapping(value = &quot;/search&quot;, produces = MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON_VALUE) public ResponseEntity&lt;Object&gt; personSearch(@RequestBody final Map&lt;String,String&gt; map) { // extract term from RequestEntity String term = (String) map.get(&quot;term&quot;); // JPA query to filter on term List&lt;Person&gt; list = repository.findByNameContainingIgnoreCaseOrEmailContainingIgnoreCase(term, term); // return resulting list and status, error checking should be added return new ResponseEntity&lt;&gt;(list, HttpStatus.OK); } /* The personStats API adds stats by Date to Person table */ @PostMapping(value = &quot;/setStats&quot;, produces = MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON_VALUE) public ResponseEntity&lt;Person&gt; personStats(@RequestBody final Map&lt;String,Object&gt; stat_map) { // find ID long id=Long.parseLong((String)stat_map.get(&quot;id&quot;)); Optional&lt;Person&gt; optional = repository.findById((id)); if (optional.isPresent()) { // Good ID Person person = optional.get(); // value from findByID // Extract Attributes from JSON Map&lt;String, Object&gt; attributeMap = new HashMap&lt;&gt;(); for (Map.Entry&lt;String,Object&gt; entry : stat_map.entrySet()) { // Add all attribute other thaN &quot;date&quot; to the &quot;attribute_map&quot; if (!entry.getKey().equals(&quot;date&quot;) &amp;&amp; !entry.getKey().equals(&quot;id&quot;)) attributeMap.put(entry.getKey(), entry.getValue()); } // Set Date and Attributes to SQL HashMap Map&lt;String, Map&lt;String, Object&gt;&gt; date_map = new HashMap&lt;&gt;(); date_map.put( (String) stat_map.get(&quot;date&quot;), attributeMap ); person.setStats(date_map); // BUG, needs to be customized to replace if existing or append if new repository.save(person); // conclude by writing the stats updates // return Person with update Stats return new ResponseEntity&lt;&gt;(person, HttpStatus.OK); } // return Bad ID return new ResponseEntity&lt;&gt;(HttpStatus.BAD_REQUEST); } } . Test RESTController . Recommend testing RESTController with Curl or Postman. . Curl is command line oriented (not shown) but can be used for automation. For instance, you could use it with Bash to load test data. | PostMan is more visual or &quot;browser like&quot;. Test outputs will show Postman visuals and discuss highlight different access methods. These methods are implementations available in RestController. | . Adding record using Params and POST. . Listing records using GET. . Searching records using Body raw and JSON using POST. This is preferred method to secure transmission . Delete record using DELETE. . Setting stats using Body raw and JSON using POST. This again is preferred method to secure transmission . Collection, List, ArrayList, HashMap . Using Collection, List, and ArrayList enables a POJO to reference other POJOs. Often in Java you will see these different terms, here is a brief rundown... . A Collection is an interface that defines the highest-level of shared collection behavior, and extends Iterable which allows usage of ForEach loop. | A List is an interface that defines the highest-level of shared List behavior. The type List has in its contract that all elements have an order, that the order will not change except through intended manipulation. Key interfaces:A List allows get() the n&#39;th element; A List defines add() to put new elements at the end. - ArrayList is an implementation of List. ArrayList should not be used in an API, only for implementation details. | . HashMap . HashMap may be more suited to having days in the same POJO. . HashMap requires keys in key/value relationship to be unique. Data by date is formed in unique Key/Value pairs. | . Hacks . Start with Person POJO. See that HashMap is built in. . Build tester method (public static void main) for Person Pojo. Test zero argument and all argument constructor. build toString method to display attributes of the class. | Build other attributes into POJO that where mentioned in project dialog at the beginning of this blog. Add 1 or more APIs. Use Issues to plan and track work. | Correct the BUG in setStats! Currently, it won&#39;t let you do more than one date. | . &quot;stats&quot;:{ &quot;2022-11-13&quot;: { &quot;calories&quot;: 2200, &quot;steps&quot;: 8000 } . SQL (Extras) . Start thinking about building other data into POJOs. Use your own example or alter it for a different application. . PBL/SQL Relationships. In POJOs you can define a relationship in SQL, the POJO Person and a POJO Day can be built to contain relationships (alternate to HashMap style). List is the interface and ArrayList is the implementation. It is possible to nest Lists in Lists for 2D. Read this article for Background. | . /* &quot;1 to Many&quot; and &quot;Many to 1&quot; - 1 Person to Many Day(s) Relationship (Forward) - Many Days to 1 Person Relationship (Reverse) - symbol &quot;-|&quot; means the Day to Person must contain a result - symbol &quot;O&lt;-&quot; means there are zero to many Day(s) were data is collected -- -- | Person | -|--O&lt;- | Day | -- -- */ // Relationship shown, data is incomplete @Entity public class Person { // Person data // relationship @OneToMany( cascade = CascadeType.ALL, orphanRemoval = true ) private List&lt;Day&gt; days = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;(); } // Relationship shown, data is incomplete @Entity public class Day { // attributes, how would you track days. perhaps capture date and have many method to calculate this data private int year; private int day; private int steps; // relationship @ManyToOne(fetch = FetchType.LAZY) private Person person; } .",

Tech Talk observers clone: Spring Portfolio Project and open in VSCode. - Tech Talk observers: Download PostMan | These methods could be endpoints of an API. | The APCalendar class could be built out to provide interesting facts about Year and Date to support a PBL application | The class APCalendar shown is described as a Prototype. Why?. | . // Prototype Implementation public class APCalendar { /** Returns true if year is a leap year and false otherwise. * isLeapYear(2019) returns False * isLeapYear(2016) returns True */ private static boolean isLeapYear(int year) { // implementation not shown return false; } /** Returns the value representing the day of the week * 0 denotes Sunday, * 1 denotes Monday, ..., * 6 denotes Saturday. * firstDayOfYear(2019) returns 2 for Tuesday. */ private static int firstDayOfYear(int year) { // implementation not shown return 0; } /** Returns n, where month, day, and year specify the nth day of the year. * This method accounts for whether year is a leap year. * dayOfYear(1, 1, 2019) return 1 * dayOfYear(3, 1, 2017) returns 60, since 2017 is not a leap year * dayOfYear(3, 1, 2016) returns 61, since 2016 is a leap year. */ private static int dayOfYear(int month, int day, int year) { // implementation not shown return 1; } /** Returns the number of leap years between year1 and year2, inclusive. * Precondition: 0 &lt;= year1 &lt;= year2 */ public static int numberOfLeapYears(int year1, int year2) { // to be implemented in part (a) return 0; } /** Returns the value representing the day of the week for the given date * Precondition: The date represented by month, day, year is a valid date. */ public static int dayOfWeek(int month, int day, int year) { // to be implemented in part (b) return 0; } /** Tester method */ public static void main(String[] args) { // Private access modifiers System.out.println(&quot;isLeapYear: &quot; + APCalendar.isLeapYear(2022)); System.out.println(&quot;firstDayOfYear: &quot; + APCalendar.firstDayOfYear(2022)); System.out.println(&quot;dayOfYear: &quot; + APCalendar.dayOfYear(1, 1, 2022)); // Public access modifiers System.out.println(&quot;numberOfLeapYears: &quot; + APCalendar.numberOfLeapYears(2000, 2022)); System.out.println(&quot;dayOfWeek: &quot; + APCalendar.dayOfWeek(1, 1, 2022)); } } . Hacks . Completes APIs and methods not completed. . Implement FRQ1 in Spring project, use Spring Portfolio mvc/calendar for starter code | Enhance APCalendar.java to provide interesting facts on years, be creative and enhance/finish provided methods. For instance, use a random number or date to complete APCalendar day-of-week method. Or, better see if there is algorithm to figure methods out. Ask your team, pair, crossover, and slack before you ask me. | Enhance APIs and @RESTController to work with the all POJOs and APCalendar. | Test APIs with Browser, Curl, or Postman. Illustrate or show tangibles. | Test and use VSCode Debugger in development. Illustrate or show tangibles. | Demo and Debugging | . REST Serializing and Deserializing Year objects is necessary. There is completed example. . Read ObjectMapper and Write ObjectMapper. ObjectMapper provides functionality for reading and writing JSON, either to and from basic POJOs (Plain Old Java Objects), or to and from a general-purpose JSON Tree Model (JsonNode).&gt; FYI, in FRQ2 you will see REST Serialization is mostly automatic with JPA | REST documentation | . package com.nighthawk.spring_portfolio.mvc.calendar; import org.springframework.http.ResponseEntity; import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping; import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.PathVariable; import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RequestMapping; import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController; import com.fasterxml.jackson.core.JsonProcessingException; import com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.JsonMappingException; import com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.JsonNode; import com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ObjectMapper; /** Calendar API * Calendar Endpoint: /api/calendar/isLeapYear/2022, Returns: {&quot;year&quot;:2020,&quot;isLeapYear&quot;:false} */ @RestController @RequestMapping(&quot;/api/calendar&quot;) public class CalendarApiController { /** GET isLeapYear endpoint * ObjectMapper throws exceptions on bad JSON * @throws JsonProcessingException * @throws JsonMappingException */ @GetMapping(&quot;/isLeapYear/{year}&quot;) public ResponseEntity&lt;JsonNode&gt; getIsLeapYear(@PathVariable int year) throws JsonMappingException, JsonProcessingException { // Backend Year Object Year year_obj = new Year(); year_obj.setYear(year); // evaluates Leap Year // Turn Year Object into JSON ObjectMapper mapper = new ObjectMapper(); JsonNode json = mapper.readTree(year_obj.isLeapYearToString()); // this requires exception handling return ResponseEntity.ok(json); // JSON response, see ExceptionHandlerAdvice for throws } // add other methods } . package com.nighthawk.spring_portfolio.mvc.calendar; /** Simple POJO * Used to Interface with APCalendar * The toString method(s) prepares object for JSON serialization * Note... this is NOT an entity, just an abstraction */ class Year { private int year; private boolean isLeapYear; // zero argument constructor public Year() {} /* year getter/setters */ public int getYear() { return year; } public void setYear(int year) { this.year = year; this.setIsLeapYear(year); } /* isLeapYear getter/setters */ public boolean getIsLeapYear(int year) { return APCalendar.isLeapYear(year); } private void setIsLeapYear(int year) { // this is private to avoid tampering this.isLeapYear = APCalendar.isLeapYear(year); } /* isLeapYearToString formatted to be mapped to JSON */ public String isLeapYearToString(){ return ( &quot;{ &quot;year &quot;: &quot; +this.year+ &quot;, &quot; + &quot; &quot;isLeapYear &quot;: &quot; +this.isLeapYear+ &quot; }&quot; ); } /* standard toString placeholder until class is extended */ public String toString() { return isLeapYearToString(); } public static void main(String[] args) { Year year = new Year(); year.setYear(2022); System.out.println(year); } } .",

Summary of Points . 1.8 of 2 points for scoring above 50% | 1 point on blog | . Extra Credit Review and Makeups must be complete before EOD Thu . Posters is an example . Coding for Extra Credit . There are always opportunities to show understanding of coding. This weekend I was observing World-O-Meter. How would you do this with our group projects. . Step 1 - JavaScript document element updates . Below is a code segment that updates a clock on a page every second, adaptation would be to update data from API fetch on an interval, then updating all document elements after fetch. . // Clock Control // clockElement global element set for convenience let clockElement = document.getElementById(&#39;clock&#39;) // Execute clock function on load clock(); // Clock update executes on each interval set by timer function clock() { let date = new Date(); clockElement.textContent = date.toLocaleString(); } // Clock refresh timer, a reoccurring event setInterval(clock, 1000); . Step 2 - JavaScript update backend content . To make the updates document elements meaningful you would need to have an interval to update the Haha or Boohoo content. This could be done in same or different JavaScript timer. This would be calling appropriate fetch in add to the counters. Together, these would give the same effect as the World-O-Meter. . Step 2 (Java Option) - update backend content . Instead of having frontend update counter, you could have backend update the counter. The below python code could be adapted for Java. . import threading # import threading def keepUpdating(): # build a function to run over and over # global variable setup global run try: run except: run = 0 print(&quot;Seconds:&quot;, run) # replace this line with updates to data run += 3 # this is update to global variable threading.Timer(3.0, keepUpdating).start() keepUpdating() # you need to call this function at application startup . Step 2 (Bash Option) - do updates on server . Update content using curl and scheduling on the system. To make a PUT request with Curl, you need to use the -X PUT command-line option. . $ curl -X PUT localhost:8080/api/like/1 . This command would need to be added to crontab or a bash script and crontab to run repeatedly. . $ crontab -l # Edit this file to introduce tasks to be run by cron. # # Each task to run has to be defined through a single line # indicating with different fields when the task will be run # and what command to run for the task .

            "content": "Runtime Link . Back-end Java Spring MVC Files . Java Database . A POJO is the foundation for making an Entity that is turned into a Database. The Java Persistent API (JPA) allows Developer to interact with the Database with fairly straightforward code. An API allows you to share and store data from your community of users. The pieces are described in this blog. . . POJO and @Entity Definition . This code shows power of Spring Annotations and Java, with a little bit of code a Developer is opening up persistent data storage, a database. . import lombok.AllArgsConstructor; import lombok.Data; import lombok.NoArgsConstructor; import javax.persistence.*; @Data // Annotations to simplify writing code (ie constructors, setters) @NoArgsConstructor @AllArgsConstructor @Entity // Annotation to simplify creating an entity, which is a lightweight persistence domain object. Typically, an entity represents a table in a relational database, and each entity instance corresponds to a row in that table. public class Jokes { @Id @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.AUTO) private Long id; // Unique identifier @Column(unique=true) private String joke; // The Joke private int haha; // Store joke likes private int boohoo; // Store joke jeers } . Java Persistence API (JPA) . The JPA is created to access the database. The JokesJpaRepository interface extends JpaRepository. This allows the developer access predefined and additionally define useful interfaces to access their persistent storage. . import java.util.List; import org.springframework.data.jpa.repository.JpaRepository; // JPA is an object-relational mapping (ORM) to persistent data, originally relational databases (SQL). Today JPA implementations has been extended for NoSQL. public interface JokesJpaRepository extends JpaRepository&lt;Jokes, Long&gt; { // JPA has many built in methods, these few have been prototyped for this application void save(String Joke); // A List&lt;Jokes&gt; findAllByOrderByJokeAsc(); // returns a List of Jokes in Ascending order List&lt;Jokes&gt; findByJokeIgnoreCase(String joke); // look to see if Joke(s) exist } . List and ArrayList . List is a super class to ArrayList. This illustration shows relationship. In the JPA code you can see that List of Jokes is common result from JPA. As a database is a series of rows, accessing a List or and ArrayList is done through similar iteration. Here is illustration of List and ArrayList from GeeksForGeeks . . Controller and APIs . The last backend piece of the process of accessing the database is building out the RESTful API services to access the data. Below is the JokesApiController, this is commented extensively. This has many AP and PBL elements. . @Autowired annotation provides full access to JokesJpaRepository, what we made with the code above. Review repository., there are actions for set, get, save and more. | @GetMapping and @PutMapping which establishes endpoints for RESTful web services to access the data. | API data structuring elements @PathVariable and “return new ResponseEntity” these are keys for obtaining and returning data from the accessor. | . import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired; import org.springframework.http.HttpStatus; import org.springframework.http.ResponseEntity; import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.*; import java.util.List; import java.util.Optional; @RestController // annotation to simplify the creation of RESTful web services @RequestMapping(&quot;/api/jokes&quot;) // all requests in file begin with this URI public class JokesApiController { // Autowired enables Control to connect URI request and POJO Object to easily for Database CRUD operations @Autowired private JokesJpaRepository repository; /* GET List of Jokes * @GetMapping annotation is used for mapping HTTP GET requests onto specific handler methods. */ @GetMapping(&quot;/&quot;) public ResponseEntity&lt;List&lt;Jokes&gt;&gt; getJokes() { // ResponseEntity returns List of Jokes provide by JPA findAll() return new ResponseEntity&lt;&gt;( repository.findAll(), HttpStatus.OK); } /* Update Like * @PutMapping annotation is used for mapping HTTP PUT requests onto specific handler methods. * @PathVariable annotation extracts the templated part {id}, from the URI */ @PutMapping(&quot;/like/{id}&quot;) public ResponseEntity&lt;Jokes&gt; setLike(@PathVariable long id) { /* * Optional (below) is a container object which helps determine if a result is present. * If a value is present, isPresent() will return true * get() will return the value. */ Optional&lt;Jokes&gt; optional = repository.findById(id); if (optional.isPresent()) { // Good ID Jokes joke = optional.get(); // value from findByID joke.setHaha(joke.getHaha()+1); // increment value repository.save(joke); // save entity return new ResponseEntity&lt;&gt;(joke, HttpStatus.OK); // OK HTTP response: status code, headers, and body } // Bad ID return new ResponseEntity&lt;&gt;(HttpStatus.BAD_REQUEST); // Failed HTTP response: status code, headers, and body } /* Update Jeer */ @PutMapping(&quot;/jeer/{id}&quot;) public ResponseEntity&lt;Jokes&gt; setJeer(@PathVariable long id) { Optional&lt;Jokes&gt; optional = repository.findById(id); if (optional.isPresent()) { // Good ID Jokes joke = optional.get(); joke.setBoohoo(joke.getBoohoo()+1); repository.save(joke); return new ResponseEntity&lt;&gt;(joke, HttpStatus.OK); } // Bad ID return new ResponseEntity&lt;&gt;(HttpStatus.BAD_REQUEST); } } . Front End . This database was setup to allow people to HaHa or Boohoo a collection of Computer Jokes. The entirety has lot of limitation. . People can vote more than once and in both categories. | There is no auto refresh if several are voting and updating as you are looking at your static page. | Perhaps Q and A style could hide punch line. | Perhaps we could accept new jokes, or have interface for adding them. | . Amazingly, though … the front-end code is in a completely different project. The front end project GETs and PUTs using the back end APIs. The key element that makes this different than other public APIs, like RapidAPI, is the “reaction” function. This function updates the elementID of the like or jeer as soon as you impact the button. . Frontend JavaScript Code . // Reaction function to likes or jeers user actions function reaction(type, put_url, elemID) { // fetch the API fetch(put_url, put_options) // response is a RESTful &quot;promise&quot; on any successful fetch .then(response =&gt; { // check for response errors if (response.status !== 200) { error(&quot;PUT API response failure: &quot; + response.status) return; // api failure } // valid response will have JSON data response.json().then(data =&gt; { console.log(data); // Likes or Jeers updated/incremented if (type === HAHA) // like data element document.getElementById(elemID).innerHTML = data.haha; // fetched haha data assigned to haha Document Object Model (DOM) else if (type === BOOHOO) // jeer data element document.getElementById(elemID).innerHTML = data.boohoo; // fetched boohoo data assigned to boohoo Document Object Model (DOM) else error(&quot;unknown type: &quot; + type); // should never occur }) }) // catch fetch errors (ie Nginx ACCESS to server blocked) .catch(err =&gt; { error(err + &quot; &quot; + put_url); }); } . Hacks . AP required. Review the lambok annotations (https://projectlombok.org/features/). . Write the POJO without using lambok | . PBL foundational.

            "content": ". GitHub and Git . GitHub.com was launched in April 2008 by Tom Preston-Werner, Chris Wanstrath, P. J. Hyett and Scott Chaco. GitHub is a subsidiary of Microsoft since 2018 (kind of ironic with Git quote below), but GitHub is not Git it helps manage the server or backend. . Linus Torvalds invented Linux and about 2005 invented Git. Quotes by Linus: . “Talk is cheap. Show me the code.” | “Most good programmers do programming not because they expect to get paid or get adulation by the public, but because it is fun to program.” | Microsoft isn’t evil; they just make really crappy operating systems. | . In our environments, Git is local and it works with GitHub/Git is in the cloud. Together these tools together have become an industry standard since about 2015. Formerly in industry we used tools like (ClearCase and Perforce), before the 90s we had home brewed systems. Kind of like making smart backups of files. . Terms and Usage . A brief review of key commands and concepts. . A “git clone” makes a local Git repository (decentralized) from the cloud server (GitHub/Git). | A .git directory contains a local database (see illustration) that keeps track of local changes. | A “git commit” makes a child snapshot of the original parent on the local database. Git commits over time are a series of Secure Hashing Algorithms (SHA’s). This is the math behind a git snapshot. | The .gitignore file tells .git to ignore certain files in directory tree (ie files constructed from source or derived files, like ipynb files that turn into md files). | The “git push” command moves files from local system back to cloud server (GitHub). However, often a merge is required as the decentralized system can have many simultaneous contributors. Students will experience this when they share a repository. | To minimize conflicts, Developers use Git branches and/or GitHub Forks to push code to an isolated locations on the server/cloud. This simply delays the inevitable merge, but has benefit of keeping developers branch of project stable. | Pull requests is common process used to merge code from isolated Fork back to the primary GitHub repository. | A “git rebase” is a common command for Developer on an isolated Git branch to update their environment from the “main” branch. Often this is done prior to a “git push” back the “main” branch. | . Project Based Learning . In Project Based Learning, it is required that you have a policy on Contributing Guidelines. Many student have already experienced problems of merging and managing change, by editing code GitHub directly, while editing code on VSCode locally. This will be an every day occurrence when starting a GitHub/Git sociology. Thus, teams need to create a policy to communicate how Scrum Team or Others should contribute to your project. . GitHub and VSCode | . Hacks . Any sociology questions within team need to be answered with a Blog, A Scrum Master working with other Developers should establish the Github administration/sociology policies: . What is the main repository for your project? | Did you create a .gitignore to avoid committing files that ‘don’t belong in version control? Look at this tool for guidance. | Have you established Issues as part of your Development process? Creating Issues | Have you considered making Pull Requests to track development? Create Pull Request | Have you considered forks or branching techniques with pull requests? Link Issue to PR | Are you managing Issues on a Project Board/Scrum Board like Kanban?

VPNs encrypt your internet traffic and disguise your online identity. This makes it more difficult for third parties to track your activities online and steal data. . How Does A VPN Work . A VPN hides your IP address by letting the network redirect it through a specially configured remote server run by a VPN host. This means that if you surf online with a VPN, the VPN server becomes the source of your data. This means your Internet Service Provider (ISP) and other third parties cannot see which websites you visit or what data you send and receive online, and which can only be accessed if one’s VPN gets hacked; however, that is extremely unlikely to happen because VPN’s are very securely encrypted. A VPN works like a filter that turns all your data into “gibberish”. Even if someone were to get their hands on your data, it would be useless. . Setting Up A VPN (MacOS) . Navigate to your browser and search for a VPN and follow the websites directions for installation | Go to “System Preferences” and then “Network” | Click on the plus sign in the bottom left corner and use the drop-down menu to choose your VPN | Fill in the details for your chosen VPN in the fields “VPN Type” and “Service Name” | Create a new VPN network and fill in your “Server Address,” “Remote ID” and “Local ID” | Enter “Authentication Settings” and add your username and password | Click “OK” and Connect your VPN | Setting Up A VPN (Windows) .

Build your own Web Service . To build a Web Service in the backend allows you to control information and errors between your app and the user. A proper Web Service requires more code:RESTful interface, error handling, and in this case reducing the calls to the service according to update frequency.- There are benefits of building service in Java vs JavaScript: . - Firewall will not be blocked as backend server on AWS is outside the firewall - Selecting frontend service https://nighthawkcodingsociety.com that has been cleared through IT. - Many APIs have usage costs or usage limits, backend can serve while limiting direct API access. .

            "content": ". Project Planning . Look for a real need, Teacher/Student need, Educational Study or Simulation, Campus Club, Campus Interest, Business Interest, Charitable Organization, mimic portions of a system like Amazon, etc. Of course, the greatest interest is Student Interest. The project will not work if only one student is interested. - Program Purpose and Function. Think about inputs, outputs, UI, and data that will be in the program. - Be sure to pick something that you don’t burn out on after a couple of weeks. If you are a couple days into something and it is not working it is best to change. - IMO, it is much more interesting to work on something that has 3rd party interest or that you design something with intention to acquire a 3rd party interest. Working on something to acquire accolades is a big motivator. . Begin a code base. Some of ideation may come in play with code. This could also be done in Jupyter Notebooks. | Data Abstraction. UML is pictured in article. Think about how data will be formed and managed. | Managing Complexity. Think about frontend and backend portions of the system. Remember that objective is to use JavaScript in frontend and Python in backend. | Procedural Abstraction. Design some of the key objects of the system. Think about the key elements of User Design. This should help you divide work amongst team. Effectually, you will be creating the sub systems of the system in this design effort. | Algorithm Implementation. The key aspects of your project and its algorithms must be considered and prototyped early. This will help you understand capabilities of team and some of the longer/research required activities. | Testing. Be sure that you are performing iteration and testing as you go. Do not stack things up or integrate infrequently. Develop, Integrate, Test a couple of times weekly!!! Also, think about the things that needs to be tested. Think about how to put data into the system to ensure quality is produced and everything is easily validated. | . Teacher Needs . PBL. Concept/Idea in CSP Education. This could be achieved using Blogging and Jupyter. Some have said, it is possible to pass the AP exam in 1 month of study. This would be several 1 hour lessons. . Highlight all 5 Big Ideas from CB. | Remake CB site to be Student Friendly, More Code, and less Video. | The Web Site covers key topics from CB, also includes Mini-labs, and thus should be interactive. The code and visuals should teach more than the words. | FRQs could be challenges or hack-a-thon activities that could enhance a Test Prep sessions. | . PBL. Concept/Idea around Classroom Management. Build data for a series of classroom needs. This could be CompSci, but these requirements are for me. . A system were students can do administration. Users and Passwords. A single source for all projects to minimize duplication of data across periods and transitions during year. Graduation year would be a big key, to active or alumni. | Access through accounts RESTful API | User Setting and Attributes for students to be self updated | . | Attributes Name, Grad year, and some other basics (birth day without year) | Password integration with Email | GitHUB ID, Slack ID | Track student history Track All GitHub projects for the user through Year (Tri 1,2,3) | Track all Period through year | Roles of Development for User through Year | Scrum Teams and other students worked with | Pull sources like GitHub commits | Runtime project that are alive | . | Integration with GithUb pages, ability to Comment on assignments | . | Backup of Data to JSON | Restore Data from JSON | . Last year Projects. I have access to student projects from last year that were never finished. Working on them and extending them is often better than starting from nothing. . Hacks . Now is time to transition to Design and Development. Designs are required and must meet Teacher Approval. If you get negative feedback act quickly. Designs should be put together around a Blog. . Brain Write. The process of just elaborating on ideas and sharing them with your team. | Wire Frame, Concept. Before coding start to outline what the project will look like. | Modeling or UML. Behavior, Interaction, Data diagrams | . Additionally, some development of Concepts can/should occur. This should be focused on frontend or backend concepts. . Frontend. Wire Frame development is better than coding, at early stages. But if you have clear idea and can articulate it in HTML or CSS it is OK to work there as well. | Backend. Jupyter notebooks is a great way to thing about data and outputs. Often a console program can help you imagine data as well as interaction. | .

Output to console using the classic programming introduction using a &quot;Hello, World!&quot; message. . The command or function is console.log() | &quot;Hello, World&quot; is a String literal. This is the referred to as Static text, as it does not change. | &quot;Hello, World&quot; is a parameter to the console.log command. | The console.log command outputs the parameter to the console, so you can see it in this Jupyter document. | Note, in a Web Application, console.log is used for debugging and is not visible from the browser via HTML. It is used behind the scenes, when using Inspect-&gt;Console from the browser. | . console.log(&quot;Hello, World!&quot;); . Hello, World! . console.log output showing use of variable . This second example is a sequence of code, two or more lines forms a sequence. This example defines a variable, then outputs the msg to terminal. . The variable &quot;var msg =&quot; is used to capture the data | The console.log(msg) outputs to console | . var msg = &quot;Hello, World!&quot;; console.log(msg); . Hello, World! . console.log output showing use of a function . This example passes the previously defined variable &quot;msg&quot; to the newly defined &quot;function logIt(output)&quot;. . There are two steps in the code, the definition of the function and the call to the function. &quot;function logIt(output) {}&quot; and everything between curly braces is the definitions of the function. | &quot;logIt(msg)&quot; is the call to the function, this actually activates the function. If you remove this line you will not receive any output to console. | . | Since the variable &quot;msg&quot; was defined in previous cell, it is used a parameter when calling the logMessage function. | . function logIt(output) { console.log(output); } logIt(msg); . Hello, World! . Showing reuse of a function . Now that a function is defined, it can be called from any of the subsequent cell in the Jupyter notebook. A function/method, is a process of creating a procedural abstraction. This a programming practice to promote reuse versus coding the same thing over and over. . First call sends a different string message | Second call sends a number | . console.log(&quot;Reuse of logIT&quot;) logIt(&quot;Hello, Students!&quot;); logIt(2022) . Reuse of logIT Hello, Students! 2022 . Dynamic or Loosely typed language (string, number) . JavaScript is a loosely typed language, meaning you don&#39;t have to specify what type of information will be stored in a variable in advance. The variable type is determined at runtime. This is similar to Python and most interpretive languages. Java which is a compiled language is strongly typed, thus you will see string, integer, double, and object in the source code. In JavaScript, the &quot;typeof&quot; keyword returns the type. . function logItType(output) { console.log(typeof output, &quot;;&quot;, output); } console.log(&quot;Looking at dynamic nature of types in JavaScript&quot;) logItType(&quot;hello&quot;); // String logItType(2020); // Number logItType([1, 2, 3]); // Object is generic for this Array, which similar to Python List . Looking at dynamic nature of types in JavaScript string ; hello number ; 2020 object ; [ 1, 2, 3 ] . Build a Person Function/Class object and JSON . JavaScript functions have special properties and syntax is shown in many ways. In fact, a Class in JavaScript is a special function. Jupyter Notebooks seems to be more friendly to &quot;function&quot; definitions versus &quot;Class&quot;, thus this lesson uses &quot;function&quot; and &quot;prototype&quot; versus &quot;Class&quot;. . Definition of function allows for a collection of data, the &quot;function Person&quot; allows programmer to retain name, github id, and class of designation. | Definition of a prototype allow for the definition of a method associated with the function , the &quot;Person.prototype.toJSON&quot; allows the collection of data to be expressed in a json/string versus JavaScript object. | Instance of a function, the &quot;var teacher = new Person(&quot;Mr M&quot;, &quot;jm1021&quot;, 1977)&quot; line makes a variable &quot;teacher&quot; which is an object representation of &quot;function Person&quot;. | . // define a function to hold data for a Person function Person(name, ghID, classOf) { this.name = name; this.ghID = ghID; this.classOf = classOf; this.role = &quot;&quot;; } // define a setter for role in Person data Person.prototype.setRole = function(role) { this.role = role; } // define a JSON conversion &quot;method&quot; associated with Person Person.prototype.toJSON = function() { const obj = {name: this.name, ghID: this.ghID, classOf: this.classOf, role: this.role}; const json = JSON.stringify(obj); // json/string is useful when passing data on internet return json; } // make a new Person and assign to variable teacher var teacher = new Person(&quot;Mr M&quot;, &quot;jm1021&quot;, 1977); // object type is easy to work with in JavaScript logItType(teacher); // before role logItType(teacher.toJSON()); // ok to do this even though role is not yet defined // output of Object and JSON/string associated with Teacher teacher.setRole(&quot;Teacher&quot;); // set the role logItType(teacher); logItType(teacher.toJSON()); . object ; Person { name: &#39;Mr M&#39;, ghID: &#39;jm1021&#39;, classOf: 1977, role: &#39;&#39; } string ; {&#34;name&#34;:&#34;Mr M&#34;,&#34;ghID&#34;:&#34;jm1021&#34;,&#34;classOf&#34;:1977,&#34;role&#34;:&#34;&#34;} object ; Person { name: &#39;Mr M&#39;, ghID: &#39;jm1021&#39;, classOf: 1977, role: &#39;Teacher&#39; } string ; {&#34;name&#34;:&#34;Mr M&#34;,&#34;ghID&#34;:&#34;jm1021&#34;,&#34;classOf&#34;:1977,&#34;role&#34;:&#34;Teacher&#34;} .

IJavaScript and Table formatting using toHTML method . This example builds a Classroom method _toHTML which is passed to the IJavaScript interpreter $$.html which renders output similarly to a real website. . JavaScript in the _toHTML method is broken into three parts... Style part is building CSS inline formatting | Body part is constructing the Table Rows (tr), Table Headings (th), and Table Data (td). The table data is obtained from a Classroom object. The JavaScript for loop allows the construction of a new row of data for each index in the Array. | Return part create the HTML fragment for rendering | . | The last line in the example $$.html is IJavaScript HTML interpreter and by passing the parameter of the _toHTML method it obtains HTML to render | . Reference . // define an HTML conversion &quot;method&quot; associated with Classroom Classroom.prototype._toHtml = function() { // HTML Style is build using inline structure var style = ( &quot;display:inline-block;&quot; + &quot;border: 2px solid grey;&quot; + &quot;box-shadow: 0.8em 0.4em 0.4em grey;&quot; ); // HTML Body of Table is build as a series of concatenations (+=) var body = &quot;&quot;; // Heading for Array Columns body += &quot;&lt;tr&gt;&quot;; body += &quot;&lt;th&gt;&lt;mark&gt;&quot; + &quot;Name&quot; + &quot;&lt;/mark&gt;&lt;/th&gt;&quot;; body += &quot;&lt;th&gt;&lt;mark&gt;&quot; + &quot;GitHub ID&quot; + &quot;&lt;/mark&gt;&lt;/th&gt;&quot;; body += &quot;&lt;th&gt;&lt;mark&gt;&quot; + &quot;Class Of&quot; + &quot;&lt;/mark&gt;&lt;/th&gt;&quot;; body += &quot;&lt;th&gt;&lt;mark&gt;&quot; + &quot;Role&quot; + &quot;&lt;/mark&gt;&lt;/th&gt;&quot;; body += &quot;&lt;/tr&gt;&quot;; // Data of Array, iterate through each row of compsci.classroom for (var row in compsci.classroom) { // tr for each row, a new line body += &quot;&lt;tr&gt;&quot;; // td for each column of data body += &quot;&lt;td&gt;&quot; + compsci.classroom[row].name + &quot;&lt;/td&gt;&quot;; body += &quot;&lt;td&gt;&quot; + compsci.classroom[row].ghID + &quot;&lt;/td&gt;&quot;; body += &quot;&lt;td&gt;&quot; + compsci.classroom[row].classOf + &quot;&lt;/td&gt;&quot;; body += &quot;&lt;td&gt;&quot; + compsci.classroom[row].role + &quot;&lt;/td&gt;&quot;; // tr to end line body += &quot;&lt;tr&gt;&quot;; } // Build and HTML fragment of div, table, table body return ( &quot;&lt;div style=&#39;&quot; + style + &quot;&#39;&gt;&quot; + &quot;&lt;table&gt;&quot; + body + &quot;&lt;/table&gt;&quot; + &quot;&lt;/div&gt;&quot; ); }; // IJavaScript HTML processor receive parameter of defined HTML fragment $$.html(compsci._toHtml()); .

Hacks . Objective of JavaScript is to produce frontend code. Working in Jupyter Notebooks could help in the process of visualizing design with short and interactive feedback. However, my hope is that you move to Fastpages and play with Frontend code in that environment and do the REAL thing. Here is my suggestion. . Design UI screens that are prototypes for your project. Design at least one screen with data from a structure (like Person data above), that is used to dynamically create HTML. As an alternative to HTML text method above, look at Jokes post and usage createElement... . const resultContainer = document.getElementById(&quot;result&quot;); ... build data table .... for (const row of data) { // tr for each row const tr = document.createElement(&quot;tr&quot;); // td for each column const joke = document.createElement(&quot;td&quot;); const haha = document.createElement(&quot;td&quot;); const boohoo = document.createElement(&quot;td&quot;); // data is specific to the API joke.innerHTML = row.joke; haha.innerHTML = row.haha; boohoo.innerHTML = row.boohoo; // this build td&#39;s into tr tr.appendChild(joke); tr.appendChild(haha); tr.appendChild(boohoo); // add HTML to container resultContainer.appendChild(tr); } .",

The layouts/base.html is structural beginning file for index.html, greet.html, birds.html or any future file added to this project. This connection is made at the top of each HTML template, layout:decorate=”~{layouts/base}”. . As you look at the contents of the layouts/base.html think of it as the structure and common contents that will be in every HTML file.

Service in deployment will cache these files for quick loading over the internet. | static/sccs - these are cached as well. This location and the sccs name state this will work with node tools. The standard is called Sassy and is the same as used in Python Flask projects. | templates/error - error pages can be placed here. Can you guess were you would put a 500 error page. | application.properties - this resource is used to define defaults for the application. Most of these default are used by backed, for instance this will be used to define location of a database. This is similar to __init__.py. | . .",

            "content": "Agile Methodology . . Agile software development uses practices such as pair programming, test-driven development, stand-ups, planning sessions, and sprints. Agile includes the 12 Principles expressed in the Manifesto for Agile Software Development. . . Roles . To ensure transparency during the sprint the Team should meet daily at the daily scrum ( sometimes called a standup). As adaptation for classroom, Team should have a standup meeting for weekly plans, should have assignments for tasks, assignments for integration and deployment. . Scrum Master: The scrum master helps to facilitate the sprint by ensuring that an agile framework is followed. He/she is committed to tracking issues and maintaining scrum boards, but should also remain flexible and open to opportunities for the team to improve their workflow. | DevOps: DevOps is the combination of cultural philosophies, practices, and tools that increases an team’s ability to deliver applications and services at high velocity: version control, integration, managing dependencies, POM file management, AWS deployment are some of the key functions that impact velocity. | Development Team: The development team can be comprised of all kinds of people including designers, writers, presenters, developers, etc. Two key roles in Web Development are … Frontend Developer: A front-end developer builds the front-end portion of websites and web applications—that is, the part that users actually see and interact with. | Backend Developer: Back-end developers a build and maintain the mechanisms that process data and perform actions like data storage, security, and other server-side functions that you cannot see. | . | . Workload . When planning there is an expectation of time. . Individual in Class Time. You should expect 3 to 4 hours of productive classroom work each week. | Individual at Home Time. To maintain pace in this class, you should consider a 2 hour coding or design session (weekly) outside of class time. | Sprint Calculation Time. 5-6 hours of coding or planning per week per individual, or 20-24 hours per team. If we had a two week Sprint this would be 40-48 hours of work. | Key to success. Make great use of time in class. Pair share programming typically provides three time dividend over individual programming when you are learning something new. | . Issues . Sprint cadences have ideas/issues that are broken into short term work units called tasks. . Scrum Board / GitHub Project / Kanban Style . The Scrum Board contains issues that are assigned to individuals, each of these issues will have tangible deliverable links (code/video/…). Scrum Team will use Scrum Board to understand everyone’s ideas and efforts. This includes individual tasks. Use GitHub Projects add Issues to the board. Issues are placed in columns on a Scrum Board (Kanban) to represent progress. The below columns have been successful in our academic environment. . To do/backlog | In progress | Complete | Deployed | Done | Sprint . Sprint is a period of time that Team uses to plan work and execute work. This includes planning, research, development, deployment, and test. Typically, sprints will be 2 weeks or longer in the classroom. Anytime a sprint lasts longer than a week, there will be a weekly Review Tickets (formative assessment) and concluding with an end of Review Ticket (summative assessment). Sample sprint follows… . Week 1 Monday - Sprint Objectives, Scrum Team Planning | Tuesday - Test Prep Tuesday (Student Led) | Wednesday - Code, Code, Code | Thursday - Tech Talk (Teacher) | Friday - Code, Code, Code; Teacher 1 v 2, formative review | 2 hours outside of class for project work | . | Week 2 Monday - Sprint Crossover Grading, Scrum Team Planning | Tuesday - Test Prep Tuesday (Student Led) | Wednesday - Code, Code, Code | Thursday - Tech Talk (Teacher) | Friday - Code, Code, Code; Teacher 1 v 4 including Demos/Review Ticket/Peer, summative review | 2 hours outside of class for project work | . | . 7 Important Transferable Skills .

Make sure Point total is a the top of ticket, if points are important to you! All assessments will be looking for these 7 elements in your work… . Creativity Creativity doesn’t necessarily mean you paint or draw or sculpt well. Creativity in education and workplace, in many cases, presents itself in terms of how you approach tasks and solve problems, Do you both inside and outside of the box for solutions? Or, do you stick to a planned system? If you solve even the smallest problem, you’ve demonstrated creativity. This skill scales up: Big problems are enlarged small problems; small problems scaled are big problems. Conceptualize problems and solutions | Display foresight | Make connections | Make intelligent inferences | Synthesize ideas and data | . | Critical thinking Solving complex or abstract problems requires critical thinking, especially when the problems are critical. Not only that, but critical thinking skills also enable the discovery of deficiencies that could cause less than optimal results. The ability to take a step back and look at things more critically and say ‘Where might we have to have gotten this wrong?’ or ‘How might we be able to improve this?’ is critical thinking. IIf you can articulate this skill you will stand out! | Critical thinkers head off problems before they arise. And if they do surface, they take them head-on. | . | Communication Effective communication is the crux of everything you do.. It doesn’t matter how creative or intelligent you are, or how many computer languages you know: If you can’t communicate well, your other skills are meaningless. Students are encouraged to talk about how they were able to bring their teams together. Verbal skills. How do you address an audience in terms they can understand. | Listening skills. Learning and understanding without defensiveness. | Writing skills. You need to be able to write in such a way that non-experts will understand. | Technological communication skills. You should be able to discuss highly technical hard skills in a way appropriate to your audience. Communication details are not the same for all audiences. | . | Collaboration through Leadership Leadership skills generally encompass communication, problem-solving and managing conflict, relationship building and being able to get people on your team on board with a mission or project. Leaders are big-picture thinkers who take various interests into account when making major decisions. Leaders are responsible for: Delegating responsibility | Demonstrating effective time management | Initiating new ideas | Major decision-making | Managing conflict | Managing groups | Multitasking | Teaching and mentoring | . | Collaboration - Teamwork Individuals that work well with others. This is a important category mentioned in early school. But it applies to High School, College and adults. Trust is the major difference between working alone versus working in groups. And trust can be hard: Some people are skeptical by nature or want to work through an entire project lifecycle solo. But placing trust in an active, dynamic team provides more than just project completion. Teamwork — a sense of community — elevates spirits and improves productivity. Accepting responsibility | Making and implementing decisions | Managing time wisely | Meeting both short- and long-term goals | Organizing | Setting and meeting deadlines | . | Researching Research is not a process performed by Teacher, Boss, or some upstream process. Everything you do in Technology requires research. Research is a key part of the lifecycle: changing plans, fluctuating results, and roadblocks require research before anyone can take action. Conversing with team members is a form of research: If you’ve asked a peer’s opinion on a technical matter, you’ve performed research. Analyzing information | Brainstorming solutions | Delineating needs and requirements | Extracting information from data | Gathering information | Forecasting possible roadblocks | Setting goals | Solving problems | . | Technical We live in a tech-heavy world, and you need to understand the tech your project requires.

            "content": "It’s often useful to test pages locally before deploying, as it can save time and be helpful for testing quick changes/debugging. In this blog we’ll learn how to deploy fastpages locally using Docker. . Overview of steps . Download Docker desktop | (For Windows) Set up Docker with WSL | Run make server in repo directory | Click in terminal or type localhost link show (ex. http://127.0.0.1:4000/{repo name}) to view your Fastpages Blog site. | 1. Installation . Docker is a lightweight method to build, deploy, run, update and manage containers. Download Docker desktop from following links: . Windows: https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/ Mac: https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/. . Now, each time you want to make server, you need to start Docker desktop or make sure it running. Make sure you do this before building locally! . 2. (For Windows) Set up Docker with WSL . For Windows, to set up Docker with WSL use https://docs.docker.com/desktop/windows/wsl/. . (Optional) Download Docker extension in VSCode . VSCode has an extension too make it easier to manage docker containers and images directly in your IDE. To download, go to the Extensions tab of VSCode (left bar, or Ctrl+Shift+X), search “Docker” and download the extension from Microsoft. You should now see a docker icon on the left bar, which you can click on to see your Docker connections. . 3. Using VSCode Terminal, run: make server . In the local repository, make sure you are cd’ed to the base/root directory (i.e. where the Makefile is). For Ellen that was the ap-csa-fastpages directory as pictured. For Mr M, cd ~/vscode/APCSA sets him in his APCSA repository, here the make server command will work if Docker is running. . . The Makefile contains common aliased commands for building and serving your fastpages locally. If you look inside the file or run make in terminal, you can see what docker commands it can run. . . Specifically, we are interested in the make server command, which will build the container the first time and start the Jekyll server. If you remember from APCSP, Jekyll is what powers Github pages behind the scenes. You can build your GitHub Pages site locally using Jekyll to preview and test changes to your site. . Special steps for Windows . The first time, you might get this issue: . . If that’s the case, make sure this setting is toggled on in Docker desktop settings: . . It should ask you to reload and if you run the command again it should work now. . 4. View blog . After running, look for link to run Server. For me, this was http://127.0.0.1:4000/{repo name}: . Server address: http://127.0.0.1:4000/ . Server running… press ctrl-c to stop. . Shift-click server address to launch in Browser. . Leave the server running!!! . Make edits in VSCode and save the file. On each save, watch terminal in VSCode to see updates and regeneration of WebSite. . Refresh or click to Web page of change and you will see updates almost instantly. Refer to VSCode terminal to see any error encountered when running your server. As indicated ctrl-c will stop the server, however, I have left it running for hours of edits, testing, and commits to GitHub. . Alert, when you are satisfied with local changes… you must ✔️Commit and Sync to GitHub. The local server is used to preview and test change prior to Sync. Only after Sync, will others be able to see your changes. . . Add to .gitignore . A side effect of building locally is that it converts all the .ipynb and .docx files to .md. This means that some files will have duplicates after building – one in .ipynb or .docx, another in .md form. . To avoid duplicates masters when pushing to github, add the md generated files from to the .gitignore. This can be done by right clicking md file when preparing commits. Below is a sample .gitignore. The 1st three lines should be universal to all fastpages projects, the other files are specific to your project. . # Ignore from local build settings.ini Gemfile.lock images/copied_from_nb/ _posts/2022-08-15-AP-anatomy.md _posts/2022-08-22-HM-anthony_and_sahil.md _posts/2022-08-22-TT-darkmode.md _posts/2022-08-22-AP-primitives.md _posts/2022-08-22-TT-bash_tutorial.md _posts/2022-08-29-AP-using_java_objects.md _posts/2022-09-05-AP-boolean_ifs.md _posts/2022-09-19-TT-js_tutorial.md _posts/2022-09-26-TT-rapidapi.md .

By default it will load index.html. . // @SpringBootApplication annotation is key to building web applications with Java https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot @SpringBootApplication public class Main { // Starts a spring application as a stand-alone application from the main method public static void main(String[] args) { SpringApplication.run(Main.class, args); } } . Birds.java . This is about as simple as an @Controller can get, it loads a page for view only. Note the @GetMapping which is used to associate a Web URL (/birds) with a Java Method (public String birds()) . @Controller // HTTP requests are handled as a controller, using the @Controller annotation public class Birds { // CONTROLLER handles GET request for /birds, maps it to birds() method @GetMapping(&quot;/birds&quot;) public String birds() { // load HTML VIEW (birds.html) return &quot;birds&quot;; } } . Greet.java . Purpose of Greet is to allow user to change Hello, World! greeting. This page is VERY important to learn in order to master passing data from frontend to backend using @RequestParam with associated keys and values. The key “name” HTML input and is mapped to the Java using wrapper Class, String name. In the method, String name is made back into key value using model.addAttribute(“name”, name). In this example, nothing is altered in, but this provides feedback and response framework that can be used for more sophisticated applications. . @Controller // HTTP requests are handled as a controller, using the @Controller annotation public class Greet { // @GetMapping handles GET request for /greet, maps it to greeting() method @GetMapping(&quot;/greet&quot;) // @RequestParam handles variables binding to frontend, defaults, etc public String greeting(@RequestParam(name=&quot;name&quot;, required=false, defaultValue=&quot;World&quot;) String name, Model model) { // model attributes are visible to Thymeleaf when HTML is &quot;pre-processed&quot; model.addAttribute(&quot;name&quot;, name); // load HTML VIEW (greet.html) return &quot;greet&quot;; } } .

Deployment is the tools and service used to enable the Web Application on the Internet. The process of can use many different cloud servers, as well as choice in tools and services. . EC2: Amazon Web Services is a cloud computing platform that the PUSD district has provided for us to serve our Web Application. | GitHub: At this point in time, we should be aware that we are using GitHub is an open platform to share our Web Application code on the Internet. | Docker and docker-compose: To host a Web Application you need to prepare an environment that contains the Web Application code and all the dependencies (POM.xml for Java) Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications. | Nginx: To find a Web Application on a server, there needs to be a process to listen for the Web request and direct it to the Web Application. Nginx is an open source software for web serving, reverse proxy, caching, load balancing, media streaming, and more. | Certbot: Web traffic on internet is reliably served over Secure Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (https). Certbot is a free, open source software tool for automatically using Let’s Encrypt certifications | DNS: Natively, the web works off of IP addresses. Domain Name Services (DNS) allows the assignment of a friendly name to our Web Server. This name is built into Nginx/Certbot configuration files. Freenom is the service used to register the nighthawkcodingsociety.com domain. | . Key/Values required as you go through these procedures . Listed are Keys, you need to obtain Values. It is important that you recognize the sample Values as you work through these procedures, then replace them with the Values that are specific to your use case. . GitHub HTTPS link: | IAM user: | EC2 name: | EC2 Public IPs: | DNS Name: | DNS Subdomain name(s) | Docker Port: | docker-compose, proxy pass Port: | docker-compose, docker Image: | Nginx server file(s): | . Amazon Web Services (AWS): Electric Cloud Compute (EC2) Setup . Preparing and AWS EC2 instance is the process of creating a cloud computer. This process starts by logging into your AWS IAM user, searching for EC2. . To get started, launch a new AWS EC2 instance to learn process and understand how to work with Linux. here are some key considerations. Choose an Amazon Machine Image (AMI), the class will be using Ubuntu you should check on last verified version with a Teacher before proceeding | When it comes to picking memory or disk it is VERY important to pick Free Tier. As stated, this will only be used for testing and then it will be disposed for cost efficiency. | When presented with access dialog for http and https, make sure you check these boxes. Remember you are making a Web application that will run over http and https. | Name the security group (.pem) file after your team. It may be necessary to use SSH to access your EC2 instance. | The remainder of the steps you can use the defaults, refer to AWS documentation for guidance: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EC2_GetStarted.html | At the end of this process you need to “Connect to Instance”. This will provide you a terminal like experience. | . | . Install packages . Terminal commands are shown, these commands will be run from Terminal after you connect to your EC2 name. . Update/Upgrade all packages on your EC2 . $ sudo apt update; sudo apt upgrade . Install Java Runtime Environment . $ sudo apt install default-jre $ java -version . Install Java Development Kit . $ sudo apt install default-jdk $ javac -version . Maven is required to build project . $ sudo apt update $ sudo apt upgrade $ sudo apt install maven $ mvn -version . Clone and Change Directory to project location . These commands move your Web Application code onto you EC2 cloud computer . $ cd $ git clone https://github.com/nighthawkcoders/spring_portfolio.git . Build the Web Service . These steps will require you test Maven build prior to the final deployment process. . Maven Build and Jar package command $ cd ~/spring_portfolio $ ./mvnw package . If Maven fails, try this and repeat Maven command $ sudo apt install -y dos2unix $ dos2unix ./mvnw $ chmod +x ./mvnw . | . | Run Java Application $ cd ~/spring_portfolio $ java -jar target/spring-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar . | At this point we will type ctrl+c as we will now run a Docker File to do this step | . Create Dockerfile to run Web Service . A Dockerfile is a configuration used to run the Web Service. This is placed in a file called Dockerfile. It is best to add this to VS Code and pull it, or you can update in place with nano, vi, or vim editor and use command line commands to push it into your repository. The Dockerfile should be considered Code! . Edit the Dockerfile $ nano Dockerfile . | Insert the Dockerfile commands, note that they are similar to Bash commands performed earlier. Follow prompts on screen to save file when complete, look for Key/Value (GitHub HTTPS link) that requires change for your project. # syntax=docker/dockerfile:1 FROM openjdk:16-alpine3.13 WORKDIR /app RUN apk update &amp;&amp; apk upgrade &amp;&amp; apk add --no-cache git maven COPY . /app RUN ./mvnw package CMD [&quot;java&quot;, &quot;-jar&quot;, &quot;target/spring-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar&quot;] # EXPOSE port that is defined in spring_portfolio.git application.properties EXPOSE 8085 . | . Create docker-compose file share Web Service . A docker-compose file is a configuration used to share your Docker Web Service and resources with the Linux system. This file enable Linux to have access to the container and the persistent data application via the /volumes location. . Once again it is best to add the docker-compose.yml in VS Code and pull it. You can edit it on the machine itself using vi, vim, or nano. . Edit docker-compose.yml $ nano docker-compose.yml . | Change the docker-compose.yml Keys/Values. ports 8085:nnnn - Left 8085 is port to be used on system, by curl and Nginx config. | ports nnnn:8085 - Right 8085 is port exposed by Docker: EXPOSE 8085 | device /home/ubuntu/spring_portfolio/volumes - is my project defining a volumes directory for database and uploads outside of container yml version: ‘3’ services: web: image: java_springv1 build: . ports: “8085:8085” volumes: | persistent_volume:/app/volumes volumes: persistent_volume: driver: local driver_opts: o: bind type: none device: /home/ubuntu/spring_portfolio/volumes | . | . | . IF you cloned the repository after 9/8 you may have to change ports to 8085:8085 . Running Docker using docker-compose.yml . At this point, it is best to review complete files on GitHub and for Docker and docker-compose: https://github.com/nighthawkcoders/spring_portfolio. Review the Key/Values mentioned in this document. Make sure your Docker and docker-compose files a personalized to your project. . Make sure you are in project directory $ cd ~/spring_portfolio/ . | install docker-compose $ sudo apt install docker-compose -y . | Run docker-compose $ sudo docker-compose up -d . | Output from docker-compose. When running this command, docker-compose will run all the Docker steps and build a Web Application running in a Docker container, a virtual environment. | .

Here is a look at some of the commands behind the scenes. None of these are required to get things working, but show the results of the Docker and docker-compose.yml files and commands. . docker-compose ps The running Web process, “ps” is a linux command or option that provides information related to the processes on a system.

Preparing the Docker Web Application for Internet Access . There are a couple of steps to this preparation. We need to direct the internet to the Server running the Web Application, this is done using Domain Name Service (DNS). After being directed to the Web Server, the server needs to respond to the Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP), this will be manged by Nginx. Additionally, we will be required to support Secure HTTP (HTTPS), a utility called Certbot will augment our Nginx configuration with a certificate. . DNS provider and setup . Each student scrum team is required to learn how to obtain a DNS provider and setup an independent domain. However, the final set up will be using a Subdomain under nighthawkcodingsociety.com. . A picture is included to show key elements in setting up a domain with a DNS provider. The nighthawkcodingsociety.com is using Freenom as its service provider. As you build your own DNS server you will need to obtain your own IP address and domain. . This illustration is dependent on… . EC2 Public IPs: 3.233.212.71 | Docker Compose Port: 8085 | DNS Name: nighthawkcodingsociety.com | DNS Subdomain name(s): battleship.nighthawkcodingsociety.com. cowboys.nighthawkcodingsociety.com | . A minimum configuration will have the two “A” type definitions using you Public IP address. These two are resolved with a single Web Application. The “CNAME” type is used for subdomains, these will resolve to a different Web Application. . . Nginx install, configuration, and services . Each student scrum team will perform Nginx installation and setup on an AWS EC2 test server. The final configuration will be on AWS server managed by Teachers or Student DevOps Engineers. . Enable Nginx to retrieve Java Web Application on internet request (Reverse Proxy)! Make a server file located at /etc/nginx/sites-available/nighthawk. . Install Nginx on Ubuntu servers $ sudo apt install nginx . | Go to location of Nginx server configuration files $ cd /etc/nginx/sites-available . | Open editor to Create your own “Nginx server configuration” $ nano nighthawk . | Edit your own Nginx server configuration making modifications to primary server file (1 required): DNS Name(s): nighthawkcodingsociety.com www.nighthawkcodingsociety.com | docker-compose, proxy pass Port: 8085 | . | . server { listen 80; listen [::]:80; server_name nighthawkcodingsociety.com www.nighthawkcodingsociety.com; location / { proxy_pass http://localhost:8085; # Simple requests if ($request_method ~* &quot;(GET|POST)&quot;) { add_header &quot;Access-Control-Allow-Origin&quot; *; } # Preflight requests if ($request_method = OPTIONS ) { add_header &quot;Access-Control-Allow-Origin&quot; *; add_header &quot;Access-Control-Allow-Methods&quot; &quot;GET, POST, OPTIONS, HEAD&quot;; add_header &quot;Access-Control-Allow-Headers&quot; &quot;Authorization, Origin, X-Requested-With, Content-Type, Accept&quot;; return 200; } } } . Or, or in addition, edit your own Nginx server configuration making modifications to subdomain file (0 to many): DNS Name(s): spring.nighthawkcodingsociety.com | docker-compose, proxy pass Port: 8085 | . | . server { listen 80; listen [::]:80; server_name spring.nighthawkcodingsociety.com; location / { proxy_pass http://localhost:8085; # Simple requests if ($request_method ~* &quot;(GET|POST|PUT)&quot;) { add_header &quot;Access-Control-Allow-Origin&quot; *; } # Preflight requests if ($request_method = OPTIONS ) { add_header &quot;Access-Control-Allow-Origin&quot; *; add_header &quot;Access-Control-Allow-Methods&quot; &quot;GET, POST, OPTIONS, PUT, HEAD&quot;; add_header &quot;Access-Control-Allow-Headers&quot; &quot;Authorization, Origin, X-Requested-With, Content-Type, Accept&quot;; return 200; } } } . Activate/enabled Nginx server configuration: nginx configuration file: nighthawk | . | . $ sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/nighthawk /etc/nginx/sites-enabled $ sudo nginx -t . If there are no errors, restart NGINX so the server is an endpoint to the internet: $ sudo systemctl restart nginx . | . Testing HTTP endpoint . Before finishing, this is a good opportunity to test everything you have done. . Direct Test of Web Application Endpoint. This should return HTML related to the home page of the Web site. If this fails, you need to review Docker and docker-compose configurations. $ curl http://localhost:8085; . | Testing unsecure HTTP endpoint on the internet. Go to a browser an type your DNS domain: http://nighthawkcodingsociety.com. Timeout. This means something is wrong with EC2 Public IP. | Nginx Default page. This means DNS is working, but something is wrong with you Nginx configuration. | Broken Gateway. This means Nginx is working, but something is wrong with Web Application endpoint on machine, if this fails something is wrong with Web Application. This requires you to look at Docker and docker-compose configuration. | . | . Certbot install and configuration . Each student scrum team will learn Certbot on on AWS EC2 test server, establish working https web application. The final configuration will be on AWS server managed by Teachers or Student DevOps Engineers. . $ sudo snap install core; sudo snap refresh core $ sudo snap install --classic certbot $ sudo ln -s /snap/bin/certbot /usr/bin/certbot $ sudo certbot --nginx .

            "content": "Psychology and the Good Life, by Laurie Santos . This video is very relevant to students. Laurie Santos is a professor at Yale has produced one of the most popular classes of all time at Yale (1 of 4 students take this class). . Teacher Notes . In my first watch of this video, right after 2021-2022 school year, these were my observations in improving the well being of Computer Science at Del Norte. . The Teacher needs to reduce academic stress on students. | The Teacher needs to convince Students to form habits of successful people, as discussed in the video. These habits need to be formed collaboratively between Teacher and Student. | Students need to strive to form an attitude of success for life. This takes effort and commitment. Similar to exercise analogies discussed in video. | In active discussions with Ms Naidu who taught at Del Norte in 2021-2022, we determined the biggest weakness in students our students is Collaboration, not Technical. | Laure Santos request that students be grateful for their current situation. | . Teacher Message . The AP Computer Science classes at Del Norte in 2022-2023 is structured to do most of the work in the classroom. Students, please prioritize the 4C habits: Collaboration, Communication, Critical Thinking and Creativity in classroom. Additionally, focus, ask questions, Code/Code/Code, and make mistakes. If you do these things, you are in danger of getting 90% on all your assignments. . Agile and Psychology of the Good Life . A lot of the methods in Agile, Sprints, and Scrums are helping to establish habits and focus. As Engineers, we need to learn to put concepts together! . Habit helpers: Stand-up meetings, Issues, Scrum Board, Review Tickets, Sprints | Focus helpers: Reviewing Issues, Pair Coding, Making mistakes, Fixing Bugs, Scrum accountability | Look at my interpretation of students history over the years. How could habits apply to you and your team(s) through 2023? | . Hacks . Watch and build a vocabulary about how to use the “Psychology and the Good Life” and maintain it on GH Pages. Think about glitches we have in our mind and how we adapt to those glitches. Here are some ideas… | Blog a note of gratitude to someone on campus and someone at home, record your experience in GH Pages. | Make a gratitude list in your Blog. | Think about some goals you should set. | Think about the goals in conjunction with happy people. | .",

            "content": "Tour of Fastpages . . GitHub Pages is a static site hosting service that takes files straight from a repository on GitHub,runs the files through a build process, and publishes a website. Fastpages is built on top of GitHub pages. Fastpages automates the process of creating blog posts, so you don’t have to manually run conversion scripts. This tour begins by looking at Explorer in VS Code. There are three automations to a GH Pages / Fastpages website... . _notebooks: jupyter .ipynb files. This allows building block of markdown, python, java, javascript into a jupyter notebook. | _posts: markdown .md files. This supports frontend web design with markdown, html, and javascript. | _word: word .docx files. This allows you to save Microsoft or Google documents into a docx format. Saving these directly to _word folder will streamline steps. | . Read more or review files in the fastpages README.md . . Resources . There are many resources, tutorials, and reference for building pages with HTML and Markdown. On these subjects, I would say learn it when you need it. Right clicking on Chrome provides View Page Source on any link on the Web. The APCSA/APCSP projects have many examples within these projects. Here are a couple of Web links I often find through google or refer to when looking for ideas … . HTML on W3Schools | Markdown Cheat Sheet | . Home Page . The Home page is sourced by the index.html file. This is the file to personalize and customize your Fastpages home page. BTW, index.html is the standard name for your web sites landing page. GH Pages / Fastpages builds allows you to mix Markdown and HTML&lt;/mark&gt; within the index.html file. . Sub Pages . Look under _pages folder within the Navigator. In this directory, there are several .md files. These allow a combination of HTML and Markdown. Observe that this project has prefix of 01, 02, 03 on the .md files allows control the order of menus from left to right… . 01_search.md: This provides a very cool search on the site. The search.md is renamed but the contents are untouched from fastpages project. | 02_tags.md: This provide a very cool tagging system that is related to the “categories: categoryname” that are seen at the top of all the GH Pages / Fastpages _posts. This tags.md is renamed but the contents are untouched from fastpages project. | 03_about.md: This page is left for your individual customization, similar to index.html | Developers can add .md file of choice and order according to preference. | . Images . Look under images folder and you will see files added to support the site. Some are for customization of the site others are for pages. . Site: favicon.ico, logo.png | Pages: agile.webp, apcsa.png | . GH Pages YAML files . The _config.yml has many strings and preferences that are specific to the site. The file is full of comments that describe what can be changed and what should remain untouched. Note, the .yml files will be seen again as we begin to deploy our own site with Docker. . Hacks . Personalize index.html file and build your own Fastpages / GH Pages for personal use throughout the year. . Add _pages/notes.md or _pages/vocab.md, insert between tags.md and about.md. Use this area to capture idea and terms throughout the year. | Add some personal study or work pages. Consider how you will use these in conjunction with notes/vocab pages, search, and tagging. Publish _notebook file | Publish _post file with image | Publish _docx file from Google Doc source | . | . Extra Credit . Consider using your home page for other subjects other than Computer Science. The searching and tagging features are very powerful and could help recall. .",

My computer science journey started when I was in second grade. Khan Academy used to have a coding portion of its website, and I remember spending hours making programs that drew simple images. There was no logic involved in the coding, but as an introduction, it got me hooked on the subject. Here&#39;s a recreation of a pig that I made using Khan Academy: . . In elementary school, I used Scratch to create a plethora of games. During the summer, I also took ID Tech Camps that taught me more about game design and programming. Though some of these camps weren&#39;t that helpful in learning computer science (Minecraft mapping isn&#39;t a skill I use to day), they furthered my interest in the subject. You can check out some of my scratch projects here. . I took more computer science classes in middle school with the two GTT classes. The classes still worked a lot with Scratch, but in 8th grade, I learned more about HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python. Those classes didn&#39;t result in the best programs, but it provided a solid foundation for problem solving and syntax that I continue to build off of today. Below are a few programs that I made in eighth grade (updated to conform to modern Python standards). . &quot;&quot;&quot;Anthony Vo 11-14-17 coinflip.py To practice using random numbers&quot;&quot;&quot; #Imports random module import random #Initializes variables numberOfHeads = 0 numberOfTails = 0 #Flips coins for number in range(20): coinSide = random.randrange(2) if coinSide == 0: numberOfHeads = numberOfHeads + 1 print(&quot;Heads&quot;) else: numberOfTails = numberOfTails + 1 print(&quot;Tails&quot;) #Gives result print(f&quot;Overall, heads was flipped {numberOfHeads} times while tails was flipped {numberOfTails} times.&quot;) .

Following this retaurant&#39;s Facebook page will make you prosperous. . The next computer science class that I took was Mr. Mortensen&#39;s Intro to Computer Science class (which has since been replaced with CSP). This was probably my favorite class in all of high school; hanging out in fifth period with my friends, coding, and having an overall good time was one of the highlights of high school... which probably says something about me ;). I learned how to use GitHub in this class and really collaborate with my peers, which helped me apply my skills to a practical environment.

Anthony: My AP CSA Experience . Finally, we&#39;ve reached junior year. I took AP CSA during the quarantine year, and it helped me improve my Object Oriented Programming skills by a lot. My success in the class stemmed mostly from motivation to code; I spent my first periods coding instead of playing Roblox (which was a popular alternative that I did in my English classes), and I made sure to finish all of my assignments on time without copying from others. Mr. Mortensen&#39;s AP study plan also helped a lot. We were required to finish a CollegeBoard unit quiz every week, so I would hop in a Discord call with my group members every Friday to do the quiz together. I have a lot of fond memories of staying up until 2 AM with my friends on Friday to meet Mr. Mortensen&#39;s assignment deadline (admittedly, it was a lot more fun than it sounds). . For success in AP CSA, I would recommend completing everything on time. Though there is a grace period for a lot of assignments, if you fall behind one week and don&#39;t understand a concept, it can quickly snowball out of control. Get on top of your assignments, make sure you understand each week&#39;s concepts, and you&#39;ll succeed. You don&#39;t need to have had years of prior experience like me; you just need to try your best to understand and work on each week&#39;s work. . After junior year, I realized that I had a big hole in my repretoire. I could code well, sure, but I couldn&#39;t actually present or make anything of substance. So, as I chose senior classes, I decided on CSP to work on my web development skills. I spent the summer writing college essays, playing League of Legends, and hanging out. I also found out that I got a 5 on the AP CSA exam! When fall came, I was ready to begin creating polished websites. During that first trimester, I met a new friend... . Sahil: Starting Out . Hey, I&#39;m Sahil Samar. I&#39;m currently a senior at Del Norte, in the graduating class of 2023. . My computer science journey started out in around 8th grade when I got interested in game development. But game development was a super hard thing to start with! Unity uses a language called C#, and I didn&#39;t have any idea how to use it. I didn&#39;t really understand the architecture of Unity or C# at first; I just kind of dove in and started making projects. I would look up what I didn&#39;t know, and just copy paste in code to get things working. Even this was hard, because when something went wrong I had no idea how to fix it. But with way too many hours, I was able to make some projects. It isn&#39;t easy to get started getting into coding! By the time I got to AP CSP, I still had a lot to learn about the coding mindset. . My very first game, 3D Pong: . . Sahil: AP CSP . When I got to AP CSP, I still didn&#39;t really have an idea of how coding worked. I just knew how to find code and paste it into my project. But slowly, I began moving away from this. I met Anthony Vo, who you just read a little bit about, in my first trimester. Whenever I didn&#39;t understand something, he would always help me out. He wouldn&#39;t give me code to copy paste though. He would actually explain the code to me, so I could do it myself. This was huge for me, since I actually began to think about my code and be able to develop things on my own. Mr. Mortensen guided me through countless problems, but everytime I asked him for help I walked away with some new understanding of how to debug my code. At the start of the trimester, I would go up to Mr. Mortensen or Anthony as soon as I had a problem. But by the end of the year, I only used them as a last resort, after I had truly tried everything. At that point, I just needed a pair of fresh eyes, and not someone to guide me through the whole process. Moral of the story: you aren&#39;t expected to come in an expert at coding! But, if you use your resources properly, you can use this year to grow. You can develop the mindset of a programmer and learn how to create cool projects and debug your issues when things don&#39;t work out. . Sahil: After AP CSP . AP CSP shaped me to be the coder I am today; but you only get out of it what you put into it. If you work hard, then it can completely change your mindset (if you are a new coder), and teach you plenty of skills. After AP CSP, I was able to land a summer internship working in CS at the San Diego Supercomputer Center. During this internship, I worked with huge supercomputers and began to understand what servers really were and how they worked. Our project was called ICICLE. If you want to learn more about it, you could watch this short video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNFk5tDTtoU. I developed sophisticated authentication methods, and did a lot of &quot;firsts&quot; in the project. I went from having to be guided through basic code in CSP to creating things that had never been done before. It&#39;s possible! After doing a lot of stuff behind the scenes, we got to test our system on massive knowledge graphs and run some machine learning algorithms. . Picture of one of the computers I worked with, called Expanse: . . Knowledge Graph of Asteroids, classified using a neural network on being hazarous or not: . . I also never gave up on making games! But now, I don&#39;t really need to follow tutorials anymore. I can architect a solution on my own, and when I do need to look something up I learn from it and implement it rather than just copying it. When something goes wrong, I&#39;m not stuck; I know what to do, and I have confidence because I know that every problem has a solution. Here&#39;s a peek at one of the games I&#39;m working on now: . . Anthony: After CSP . AP CSP helped immensely with my presentation and web development skills. For reference, here&#39;s a website I made for my 10th grade AP European History Final... . . As you can see, it looks like garbage! You can also check out my extremely great 11th grade website for AP CSA here. . After taking AP CSP, my websites looked a lot better. I updated a website for my golf coach and made some personal websites. Here&#39;s a quick one that I made to create basketball teams: . . Even if you&#39;re new to CS as a whole, knowing how to make websites can help you show off the things you&#39;ve done. Whether it&#39;s a personal portfolio website, an online shop, or anything else, web development is a great skill to have. . Final Thoughts . Anthony: I hope you have a great year in this class! If you put in the time and effort, you will be really successful and gain skills that you can use for the rest of your life. Best of luck to you all! . Sahil: . Hacks .

            "title": "Primitive Data Types",
            "content": "College Board Summary . College Board focus is on primitive types of int, double, and boolean. In unit1, String is mentioned, but it is technically a Wrapper Class. The primitive type that is building block for a String is a single character called char. String is an array of char&#39;s and the uppercase S in String means it is a Class. . Data Types . Now is a good time to understand data types. There are primitive types in Java, but you should know there are Wrapper Classes. Java likes everything to be a class. String is a Non-Primitive data type that is a Class in Java. . . public class DefinePrimitives { public static void main(String[] args) { int anInt = 100; double aDouble = 89.9; boolean aBoolean = true; // not primitives but essential String aString = &quot;Hello, World!&quot;; // wrapper class shortcut assignment String aStringFormal = new String(&quot;Greetings, World!&quot;); System.out.println(&quot;anInt: &quot; + anInt); System.out.println(&quot;aDouble: &quot; + aDouble); System.out.println(&quot;aBoolean: &quot; + aBoolean); System.out.println(&quot;aString: &quot; + aString); System.out.println(&quot;aStringFormal: &quot; + aStringFormal); } } DefinePrimitives.main(null) . Input Primitive data . Input is a key concept to all programming. The assignments in previous example are &quot;static&quot; or &quot;hard coded&quot;. The examples when you use input are supplied by the user. . Scanner is the java utility class for console input. . // java style to import library import java.util.Scanner; // class must alway have 1st letter as uppercase, CamelCase is Java Class convention public class ScanPrimitives { public static void main(String[] args) { Scanner input; // primitive int input = new Scanner(System.in); System.out.print(&quot;Enter an integer: &quot;); try { int sampleInputInt = input.nextInt(); System.out.println(sampleInputInt); } catch (Exception e) { // if not an integer System.out.println(&quot;Not an integer (form like 159), &quot; + e); } input.close(); // primitive double input = new Scanner(System.in); System.out.print(&quot;Enter a double: &quot;); try { double sampleInputDouble = input.nextDouble(); System.out.println(sampleInputDouble); } catch (Exception e) { // if not a number System.out.println(&quot;Not an double (form like 9.99), &quot; + e); } input.close(); // primitive boolean input = new Scanner(System.in); System.out.print(&quot;Enter a boolean: &quot;); try { boolean sampleInputBoolean = input.nextBoolean(); System.out.println(sampleInputBoolean); } catch (Exception e) { // if not true or false System.out.println(&quot;Not an boolean (true or false), &quot; + e); } input.close(); // wrapper class String input = new Scanner(System.in); System.out.print(&quot;Enter a String: &quot;); try { String sampleInputString = input.nextLine(); System.out.println(sampleInputString); } catch (Exception e) { // this may never happen System.out.println(&quot;Not an String, &quot; + e); } input.close(); } } ScanPrimitives.main(null); . Output Primitive Data . The second key to to all programming is Output. All programming has means to format and combine data. In these examples you see descriptions of the mathematical operation combine with the result of the operation. . public class PrimitiveDivision { public static void main(String[] args) { int i1 = 7, i2 = 2; System.out.println(&quot;Integer Division&quot;); System.out.println(&quot; tint output with concatenation: &quot; + i1 + &quot;/&quot; + i2 + &quot; = &quot; + i1/i2); System.out.println(String.format(&quot; tint output with format: %d/%d = %d&quot;,i1, i2, i1/i2)); System.out.printf(&quot; tint output with printf: %d/%d = %d n&quot;,i1, i2, i1/i2); double d1 = 7, d2 = 2; System.out.println(&quot;Double Division&quot;); System.out.println(&quot; tdouble output with concatenation: &quot; + d1 + &quot;/&quot; + d2 + &quot; = &quot; + d1/d2); System.out.println(String.format(&quot; tdouble output with format: %.2f/%.2f = %.2f&quot;,d1, d2, d1/d2)); System.out.printf(&quot; tdouble output with printf: %.2f/%.2f = %.2f n&quot;,d1, d2, d1/d2); System.out.println(&quot;Casting and Remainders&quot;); System.out.printf(&quot; tint cast to double on division: %d/%d = %.2f n&quot;,i1, i2, i1/(double)i2); System.out.println(&quot; tint using modulo for remainder: &quot; + i1 + &quot;/&quot; + i2 + &quot; = &quot; + i1/i2 + &quot; remainder &quot; + i1%i2); } } PrimitiveDivision.main(null); . Grade Calculator, putting Input and Output together . Primitive types rarely stand alone. This lab uses the primitive type double, but it also introduces the wrapper class Double. Also included is one of the most common Data Structures in Java, the ArrayList. These items are put together to create a grade calculator. . public class GradeCalculator { // introduction to Double wrapper class (object) ArrayList&lt;Double&gt; grades; // similar to Python list // constructor, initializes ArrayList and call enterGrades method public GradeCalculator() { this.grades = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;(); this.enterGrades(); } // double requires test for zero versus threshold, DO NOT compare to Zero private boolean isZero(double value){ double threshold = 0.001; return value &gt;= -threshold &amp;&amp; value &lt;= threshold; } // enterGrades input method using scanner private void enterGrades() { Scanner input; while (true) { input = new Scanner(System.in); System.out.print(&quot;Enter a double, 0 to exit: &quot;); try { double sampleInputDouble = input.nextDouble(); System.out.println(sampleInputDouble); if (isZero(sampleInputDouble)) break; // exit loop on isZero else this.grades.add(sampleInputDouble); // adding to object, ArrayList grades } catch (Exception e) { // if not a number System.out.println(&quot;Not an double (form like 9.99), &quot; + e); } input.close(); } } // average calculation public double average() { double total = 0; // running total for (double num : this.grades) { // enhanced for loop total += num; // shortcut add and assign operator } return (total / this.grades.size()); // double math, ArrayList grades object maintains its size } // static main method, used as driver and tester public static void main(String[] args) { GradeCalculator grades = new GradeCalculator(); // calls constructor, creates object, which calls enterGrades System.out.println(&quot;Average: &quot; + String.format(&quot;%.2f&quot;, grades.average())); // format used to standardize to two decimal points } } // IJava activation GradeCalculator.main(null); . Hacks . Build your own Jupyter Notebook meeting these College Board and CTE competencies .

I would recommend following the steps under Install pre-built binary. | Ensure that running the command jupyter kernelspec list in your Anaconda prompt shows an output containing Java. | . Installing an Appropriate JDK for IJava . IJava requires a newer JDK, but some operating systems and Java downloads automatically come with JDK 8. This will help to make sure IJava works. . Go to this website and download the newest JDK. I downloaded the Windows/x64 build for JDK 18. Unzip the contents of the folder.

            "content": "Tools and Equipment make Development Easy . Learning Development tools, working with Projects, is the key to a rapid entry into Code/Code/Coding. A Computer, Git, and an Code Editor are the starting points for coding. Add Jupyter Notebooks (computational documents) and you bridge Computer with Data Science. The beauty of Jupyter is that it creates a computational narrative, a document that allows code and data with visual analysis, hypothesis, and conjecture. . Computers using either MacOS, Windows, or Linux are requirements for the course. | GitHub, is Git hosted in the Cloud. It is the defacto hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere in the world. Think of it as the Google Docs for Coders. Version Control is the task of keeping a software system of many versions and configurations well organized. | Version Control History of files and changes in Version Control System (ie GitHub) is very important! Ultimately, any Coder will break things or delete things! Looking at older versions and configurations at a microscopic detail is sometimes the only way to unwind bugs. | . | Visual Studio Code (abbreviations VS Code, VSCode or VSC) is a powerful Code Editor. VSCode performs a lot of magic and automation behind the scenes to make your Code/Code/Coding life easier. There is a back-in-the-day story hear, but short version is VSCode qualifies, IMO, to be called and Integrated Development Environment (IDE). It allows you to Edit files, Build your Code, and Pull/Push Code from and to the GitHub. FYI, VSCode is new to APCS this year, former IDE’s used in CompSci classes include XCode, Eclipse, and IntelliJ. | Jupyter Documents (.ipynb) is a document format for creating and sharing computational documents. These documents allow you to compute segments of Python or Java code as you are taking notes. These are new to AP CS this year, but are viewed as very powerful in gaining a quick understanding of coding concepts. Jupyter documents are often called “notebooks”. | . Equipment, accounts and tools . A laptop, bring a laptop to class every day with the Development Tools installed on it. Computers issued by the School, ie Chromebook, are not effective because of the restrictions placed on adding software by PUSD. If you have any problems obtaining a Computer where you can install software!, please attend Office Hours immediately | GitHub Account, VSCode will be used to clone/push/pull changes. GitHub is where we store and share code in the cloud, think of Google Docs but for Code. | GitHub Pages will be used to host your personal web site, notes, and experiences.

Slack is a messaging tool similar to Discord, the first year we had 35,000 message in a class. | Java is the key language you will be using in this class. Spring, Thymeleaf, HTML, CSS, JavaScript are the key supporting technicals you will be using to enhance your learning of Java. | VSCode is the code editor we will be using in this class. VSCode is more than and editor, it is called and Interactive Development Environment (IDE). | Anaconda is the environment manager. Conda is an open-source package and environment management system that runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux. | Homebrew for MacOS installs packages (Java, Python) you need for Development that Apple did not include. | Apt for WSL Ubuntu installs the packages (Java, Python) you need for Development that Ubuntu did not include. | AWS Account for cloud computing and deployment, account access will be provided by Teacher.

VSCode Marketplace and Extensions . . Visual Studio Code claims to provide just the tools a developer needs for a quick code-build-debug and version control cycle. It provides a Market Place for enhancements and more complex workflows. Before adding extensions, clone projects and see what is requested or added. Here are some extension that were added through that process or that I have added... . Extension Pack for Java, Debugger for Java: These are fundamental for Java Development | Jupyter: This supports build jupyter ipynb files from within VS Code | Code Spell Checker: Got to have it when building documents, particularly if you spell and typo like the Teacher. | IntelliCode: Got to have it when creating a code file, it will sense type of code by extension. Also, it help with syntax as you are coding. | Java / Spring behind the scenes: Language Support for Java, Maven for Java, Project Manager for Java, Spring Boot Dashboard, Spring Boot Extension Pack, Spring Initializr Java Support, Test Runner for Java | . Review Details in Marketplace for better explanation of purpose of the things explained above. There is a lot more! As you need Git help look at things like Git History and GitLens. Or, perhaps you enjoy Vim and want Vim emulation for editing, their is an extension for that. Later, there may be interest in AWS Toolkit or Deploy extensions. We will learn more about Marketplace Extensions as we do more. . . VSCode for Java .

All code you develop will be delivered to the Cloud. | Grading guidelines. There will be key technical objectives which will require producing tangibles. Essentially, it is impossible to be late with work if you work consistently attend class, work in class and turn in progressive tangibles each week. Thus, failure to have work will result in a 10% deduction. Additionally, late work must be defended in office hours. High “A” is very tough to achieve, something beyond the tangible requirements. Something that exhibits an unforced desire to Code/Code/Code. | Low “A” is consistency in producing tangibles toward Team Project and Individual GH Page according to Issues and Scrum Board plans. Plans must be consistent with key objectives and technicals. | “B” is having flaws in consistency or tangible shortcomings, but mostly on track. A flaw would be mostly working code. | “C” is a lack consistent effort, lacking tangibles. Lack of producing working Code. | Below “C” is composed of Slash/Slash/Slash offenses.

            "content": "Hello, World! . This article shows the basic language structures and constructs of Java (aka anatomy). In async order, it is critical to understand these examples and learn vocab for OOP and Creating Objects: . Object Oriented Programming | Creating Objects | Calling Methods | . Static example . The class HelloStatic contains the classic &quot;Hello, World!&quot; message that is often used as an introduction to a programming language. The &quot;public static void main(String[] args)&quot;, or main method, is the default runtime method in Java and has a very specific and ordered definition (signature). . The key terms in HelloStatic introduction: . &quot;class&quot; is a blueprint for code, it is the code definition and must be called to run | &quot;method&quot; or &quot;static method&quot; in this case, is the code to be run/executed, similar to a procedure | &quot;method definition&quot; or &quot;signature&quot; are the keywords &quot;public static void&quot; in front of the name &quot;main&quot; and the parameters &quot;String[] args&quot; after the name. | &quot;method call&quot; is the means in which we run the defined code | . // Define Static Method within a Class public class HelloStatic { // Java standard runtime entry point public static void main(String[] args) { System.out.println(&quot;Hello World!&quot;); } } // A method call allows us to execute code that is wrapped in Class HelloStatic.main(null); // Class prefix allows reference of Static Method . Dynamic Example . This example starts to use Java in its natural manner, using an object within the main method. This example is a very basic illustration of Object Oriente Programming (OOP). The main method is now used as a driver/tester, by making an instance of the class. Thus, it creates an Object using the HelloObject() constructor. Also, this Class contains a getter method called getHello() which returns the value with the &quot;String hello&quot;. . The key terms in HelloStatic introduction: . &quot;Object Oriented Programming&quot; focuses software design around data, or objects. | &quot;object&quot; contains both methods and data | &quot;instance of a class&quot; is the process of making an object, unique or instances of variables are created within the object | &quot;constructor&quot; special method in class, code that is used to initialize the data within the object | &quot;getter&quot; is a method that is used to extract or reference data from within the object. | . // Define Class with Constructor returning Object public class HelloObject { private String hello; // instance attribute or variable public HelloObject() { // constructor hello = &quot;Hello, World!&quot;; } public String getHello() { // getter, returns value from inside the object return this.hello; // return String from object } public static void main(String[] args) { HelloObject ho = new HelloObject(); // Instance of Class (ho) is an Object via &quot;new HelloObject()&quot; System.out.println(ho.getHello()); // Object allows reference to public methods and data } } // IJava activation HelloObject.main(null); . Dynamic Example with two constructors . This last example adds to the basics of the Java anatomy. The Class now contains two constructors and a setter to go with the getter. Also, observe the driver/tester now contains two objects that are initialized differently, 0 and 1 argument constructor. Look at the usage of the &quot;this&quot; prefix. The &quot;this&quot; keyword helps in clarification between instance and local variable. . The key terms in HelloDynamic introduction: . &quot;0 argument constructor&quot; constructor method with no parameter () | &quot;1 argument constructor&quot; construct method with a parameter (String hello) | &quot;this keyword&quot; allows you to clear reference something that is part of the object, data or method | &quot;local variable&quot; is a variable that is passed to the method in this example, see the 1 argument constructor as it has a local variable &quot;String hello&quot; | &quot;dynamic&quot; versus &quot;static&quot; is something that has option to change, static never changes. A class (blueprint) and objects (instance of blueprint) are generally intended to be dynamic. Constructors and Setters are used to dynamically change the content of an object. | &quot;Java OOP, Java Classes/Objects, Java Class Attributes, Java Class Methods, Java Constructors&quot; are explained if more complete detail in W3 Schools: https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_oop.asp | . // Define Class public class HelloDynamic { // name the first letter of class as capitalized, note camel case // instance variable have access modifier (private is most common), data type, and name private String hello; // constructor signature 1, public and zero arguments, constructors do not have return type public HelloDynamic() { // 0 argument constructor this.setHello(&quot;Hello, World!&quot;); // using setter with static string } // constructor signature, public and one argument public HelloDynamic(String hello) { // 1 argument constructor this.setHello(hello); // using setter with local variable passed into constructor } // setter/mutator, setter have void return type and a parameter public void setHello(String hello) { // setter this.hello = hello; // instance variable on the left, local variable on the right } // getter/accessor, getter used to return private instance variable (encapsulated), return type is String public String getHello() { // getter return this.hello; } // public static void main(String[] args) is signature for main/drivers/tester method // a driver/tester method is singular or called a class method, it is never part of an object public static void main(String[] args) { HelloDynamic hd1 = new HelloDynamic(); // no argument constructor HelloDynamic hd2 = new HelloDynamic(&quot;Hello, Nighthawk Coding Society!&quot;); // one argument constructor System.out.println(hd1.getHello()); // accessing getter System.out.println(hd2.getHello()); } } // IJava activation HelloDynamic.main(null); . Hacks . Build your own Jupyter Notebook meeting these College Board and CTE competencies . Explain Anatomy of a Class in comments of program (Diagram key parts of the class). | Comment in code where there is a definition of a Class and an instance of a Class (ie object) | Comment in code where there are constructors and highlight the signature difference in the signature | Call non-static void methods with parameter (ie setters). | . Additional requirements (Pick something) . Go through code progression of understanding Static Class usage versus Instance of a Class (Object). | Show how setters/mutators can be used to make the data in the Object dynamically change | Adapt a Class from example: Person: Name and Age, Dessert: Name and Cost | Build your own, use inspiration from examples and start building something educational in your PBL project.

            "content": "| Overview | Tutorial | Calculator | Binary | Grades | Graph | Life | Snake | . JavaScript Tutorial . console.log output . Output to console using the classic programming introduction using a &quot;Hello, World!&quot; message. . The command or function is console.log() | &quot;Hello, World&quot; is a String literal. This is the referred to as Static text, as it does not change. | &quot;Hello, World&quot; is a parameter to the console.log command. | The console.log command outputs the parameter to the console, so you can see it in this Jupyter document. | Note, in a Web Application, console.log is used for debugging and is not visible from the browser via HTML. It is used behind the scenes, when using Inspect-&gt;Console from the browser. | . console.log(&quot;Hello, World!&quot;); . Hello, World! . console.log output showing use of variable . This second example is a sequence of code, two or more lines forms a sequence. This example defines a variable, then outputs the msg to terminal. . The variable &quot;var msg =&quot; is used to capture the data | The console.log(msg) outputs to console | . var msg = &quot;Hello, World!&quot;; console.log(msg); . Hello, World! . console.log output showing use of a function . This example passes the previously defined variable &quot;msg&quot; to the newly defined &quot;function logIt(output)&quot;. . There are two steps in the code, the definition of the function and the call to the function. &quot;function logIt(output) {}&quot; and everything between curly braces is the definitions of the function. | &quot;logIt(msg)&quot; is the call to the function, this actually activates the function. If you remove this line you will not receive any output to console. | . | Since the variable &quot;msg&quot; was defined in previous cell, it is used a parameter when calling the logMessage function. | . function logIt(output) { console.log(output); } logIt(msg); . Hello, World! . Showing reuse of a function . Now that a function is defined, it can be called from any of the subsequent cell in the Jupyter notebook. A function/method, is a process of creating a procedural abstraction. This a programming practice to promote reuse versus coding the same thing over and over. . First call sends a different string message | Second call sends a number | . console.log(&quot;Reuse of logIT&quot;) logIt(&quot;Hello, Students!&quot;); logIt(2022) . Reuse of logIT Hello, Students! 2022 . Dynamic or Loosely typed language (string, number) . JavaScript is a loosely typed language, meaning you don&#39;t have to specify what type of information will be stored in a variable in advance. The variable type is determined at runtime. This is similar to Python and most interpretive languages. Java which is a compiled language is strongly typed, thus you will see string, integer, double, and object in the source code. In JavaScript, the &quot;typeof&quot; keyword returns the type. . function logItType(output) { console.log(typeof output, &quot;;&quot;, output); } console.log(&quot;Looking at dynamic nature of types in JavaScript&quot;) logItType(&quot;hello&quot;); // String logItType(2020); // Number logItType([1, 2, 3]); // Object is generic for this Array, which similar to Python List . Looking at dynamic nature of types in JavaScript string ; hello number ; 2020 object ; [ 1, 2, 3 ] . Build a Person Function/Class object and JSON . JavaScript functions have special properties and syntax is shown in many ways. In fact, a Class in JavaScript is a special function. Jupyter Notebooks seems to be more friendly to &quot;function&quot; definitions versus &quot;Class&quot;, thus this lesson uses &quot;function&quot; and &quot;prototype&quot; versus &quot;Class&quot;. . Definition of function allows for a collection of data, the &quot;function Person&quot; allows programmer to retain name, github id, and class of designation. | Definition of a prototype allow for the definition of a method associated with the function , the &quot;Person.prototype.toJSON&quot; allows the collection of data to be expressed in a json/string versus JavaScript object. | Instance of a function, the &quot;var teacher = new Person(&quot;Mr M&quot;, &quot;jm1021&quot;, 1977)&quot; line makes a variable &quot;teacher&quot; which is an object representation of &quot;function Person&quot;. | . // define a function to hold data for a Person function Person(name, ghID, classOf) { this.name = name; this.ghID = ghID; this.classOf = classOf; this.role = &quot;&quot;; } // define a setter for role in Person data Person.prototype.setRole = function(role) { this.role = role; } // define a JSON conversion &quot;method&quot; associated with Person Person.prototype.toJSON = function() { const obj = {name: this.name, ghID: this.ghID, classOf: this.classOf, role: this.role}; const json = JSON.stringify(obj); return json; } // make a new Person and assign to variable teacher var teacher = new Person(&quot;Mr M&quot;, &quot;jm1021&quot;, 1977); teacher.setRole(&quot;Teacher&quot;); // output of Object and JSON/string associated with Teacher logItType(teacher); // object type is easy to work with in JavaScript logItType(teacher.toJSON()); // json/string is useful when passing data on internet . object ; Person { name: &#39;Mr M&#39;, ghID: &#39;jm1021&#39;, classOf: 1977, role: &#39;Teacher&#39; } string ; {&#34;name&#34;:&#34;Mr M&#34;,&#34;ghID&#34;:&#34;jm1021&#34;,&#34;classOf&#34;:1977,&#34;role&#34;:&#34;Teacher&#34;} .

IJavaScript and Table formatting using toHTML method . This example builds a Classroom method _toHTML which is passed to the IJavaScript interpreter $$.html which renders output similarly to a real website. . JavaScript in the _toHTML method is broken into three parts... Style part is building CSS inline formatting | Body part is constructing the Table Rows (tr), Table Headings (th), and Table Data (td). The table data is obtained from a Classroom object. The JavaScript for loop allows the construction of a new row of data for each person object in the Array. | Return part creates the HTML fragment for rendering | . | The last line in the example $$.html is IJavaScript HTML interpreter and by passing the parameter of the _toHTML method it obtains HTML to render | . // define an HTML conversion &quot;method&quot; associated with Classroom Classroom.prototype._toHtml = function() { // HTML Style is build using inline structure var style = ( &quot;display:inline-block;&quot; + &quot;background:black;&quot; + &quot;border: 2px solid grey;&quot; + &quot;box-shadow: 0.8em 0.4em 0.4em grey;&quot; ); // HTML Body of Table is build as a series of concatenations (+=) var body = &quot;&quot;; // Heading for Array Columns body += &quot;&lt;tr&gt;&quot;; body += &quot;&lt;th&gt;&lt;mark&gt;&quot; + &quot;Name&quot; + &quot;&lt;/mark&gt;&lt;/th&gt;&quot;; body += &quot;&lt;th&gt;&lt;mark&gt;&quot; + &quot;GitHub ID&quot; + &quot;&lt;/mark&gt;&lt;/th&gt;&quot;; body += &quot;&lt;th&gt;&lt;mark&gt;&quot; + &quot;Class Of&quot; + &quot;&lt;/mark&gt;&lt;/th&gt;&quot;; body += &quot;&lt;th&gt;&lt;mark&gt;&quot; + &quot;Role&quot; + &quot;&lt;/mark&gt;&lt;/th&gt;&quot;; body += &quot;&lt;/tr&gt;&quot;; // Data of Array, iterate through each row of compsci.classroom for (var row of compsci.classroom) { // tr for each row, a new line body += &quot;&lt;tr&gt;&quot;; // td for each column of data body += &quot;&lt;td&gt;&quot; + row.name + &quot;&lt;/td&gt;&quot;; body += &quot;&lt;td&gt;&quot; + row.ghID + &quot;&lt;/td&gt;&quot;; body += &quot;&lt;td&gt;&quot; + row.classOf + &quot;&lt;/td&gt;&quot;; body += &quot;&lt;td&gt;&quot; + row.role + &quot;&lt;/td&gt;&quot;; // tr to end line body += &quot;&lt;tr&gt;&quot;; } // Build and HTML fragment of div, table, table body return ( &quot;&lt;div style=&#39;&quot; + style + &quot;&#39;&gt;&quot; + &quot;&lt;table&gt;&quot; + body + &quot;&lt;/table&gt;&quot; + &quot;&lt;/div&gt;&quot; ); }; // IJavaScript HTML processor receive parameter of defined HTML fragment $$.html(compsci._toHtml()); .

Front-end web development is the development of the graphical user interface of a website, through the use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, so that users can view and interact with that website. In this class, we will be using Fastpages on top of GitHub Pages to maximize our presentations, while minimizing our front-end coding. CSS style layout is provided by using Themes provided through GH Pages. Each page we make we assume the defined theme and insert our HTML fragments, local page style, and local page JavaScript. | Fastpages defaults to the minima theme. Review the the README.md for style or layout customizations. | GitHub Pages deployment is performed through Jekyll, which regenerates the website automatically after each commit, tracking can be seen in Actions tab within GitHub. | HTML generation is performed through Liquid, a template language (similar to Jinja2 or Thymeleaf). | JavaScript enable pages to have actions, fetch content, animate, etc | . . . Sample Code in this Sub Menu . HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are the front-end of the Web. Many tools and languages complement development using markup, style and javascript. This section of the Del Note CS website is providing some code samples. These are intended to spark your own PBL ideas. Each of these were generated after watching others teach or interacting with students. . Tutorial: This is a Jupyter Notebook built using the JavaScript kernel. This provides a few fundamentals of JavaScript language. Pull this file into VSCode and explore the fundamentals of the language. | Calculator: This calculator was inspired by Mr. Mortensen’s calculator that he built in Objective-C during his first year of teaching at DNHS. It was recreated by former student Anthony using GitHub pages, HTML, JavaScript, and CSS in 2022. | Binary: This example was created after watching Harvard CS50 by David J. Malan in 2020, he had built a machine to turn on and off lights/binary digits. My thought after watching machine, why not simulate it in software? Liquid is used to generate the HTML bits and parameters for onclick actions | JavaScript is used base 2, 8, 16 calculations | . | Grades: This grade calculator was created to show interaction of HTML and JavaScript to perform input. Additionally, it show how to add element to HTML Document Object Model (DOM). FYI, the IJavaScript kernel did not support input as of this writing. | Graph: This was created when a student named Bryant 2022 asked me the question “how would I plot data?” as described in an FRQ. JavaScript canvas is used to draw grid, axis, lines | . | Life: This was created by Nathaniel 2022 when I asked him about something interesting to show students in JS that relates to school. Built on Conway’s Game of Life (Wikipedia, Original) | Somewhat pure JavaScript, no canvas usage even though it has a grid. | . | Snake: This was interest of students in each of my 3 years, inspiration and some of the code came from a student named Nolan 2021. Contains menu and settings, as well as Grid | Uses JavaScript canvas and key events | . | .",

Java and API resource definitions are used for RESTful API definitions. Abstraction of Frontend and Backend code, the exchange of standard data format (JSON), and guidelines for exchange (REST) is a technique that saves a lot of time between developers. Learning APIs is a highly recommended step for every developer trying to break into the world of tech. . Covid19: RapidAPI example. This is introducing APIs by accessing something that already exists. RapidAPI shows how many practice RESTful definitions. Almost any data source imagined can be accessed here. | Jokes: An introduction to Java RESTful API libraries. A Java Database is used for the Data Model, providing data persistence. This example introduces concepts like JPA and POJOs. | Database CRUD: A full RESTful API example. This data if properly managed in deployment and migrated when changed can last forever. | . Web API Overview . . A Web API is an application programming interface typically for a web browser. Non-changing or Static Endpoints are used in interacting with the server-side Web APIs. RESTful Web APIs use HTTP methods to access resources via URL parameters, and use JSON for transmitting text between client and server. Server. In these examples, we will be using Java to define REST APIs. Java tools have been around a long time and thus are popular for building RESTful APIs | REST: Representational State Transfer. A set of guidelines on how to architect a network-connected software system. | Client-server: One guideline is a client and server must be decoupled from each other, allowing each to develop independently. | Layered system: The client may access the resources on the server indirectly through other layers such as a proxy or using authentication. This will be clarified by application and security requirements. | . Client. JavaScript is the frontend language used to consume data from the Python defined REST APIs. Fetch will be used to make HTTP requests, as well as handle HTTP response. There are four basic HTTP methods, they align with Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD). | GET =&gt; Retrieve/Read data | POST =&gt; Create data | PUT =&gt; Update data | DELETE =&gt; Delete data | . REST endpoints will have similarity from application to application. In planning APIs, for a Users system you can anticipate key methods. The Users RESTful APIs would likely contain these endpoints. | GET: /users =&gt; Get a list of users | GET: /users(id) =&gt; Get a single user | POST: /users =&gt; Create a new user | PUT: /users(id) =&gt; Update a user | DELETE: /users(id) =&gt; Delete a user | . Once a RESTful API receives and processes an HTTP request, it will return an HTTP response. Included in this response is an HTTP status code. Common status codes are shown. | 200 =&gt; OK, this response will then have the promise of JSON data | 400 =&gt; Bad Request | 404 =&gt; Not Found | 500 =&gt; Internal Server Error (aka bug) | . . . .",
