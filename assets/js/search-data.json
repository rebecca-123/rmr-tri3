            "content": "Spring Security using Java Web Tokens Competition . JWT Hello Articles | . JWT concepts via ChatGPT with added illustrations . JSON Web Token (JWT) is a popular way to authenticate users in a web application. It is a compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties. The claims in a JWT are encoded as a JSON object that is digitally signed using JSON Web Signature (JWS). Here is an example of how you might use JWT for authentication in a JavaScript application: . The client sends a login request to the server with the user’s credentials (e.g., username and password). Client/Origin: https://nighthawkcoders.github.io | Server/Host: spring.nighthawkcodingsociety.com | . | If the credentials are valid, the server generates a JWT and sends it back to the client. Here ae some sample credentials. Sec-Fetch-Mode: cors | Sec-Fetch-Site: cross-site | . | The client stores the JWT in a cookie. Here is cookie in Chrome Inspect properties | . | For subsequent requests, the client sends the JWT in the Authorization header. Here is a sample JWT. jwt=eyJhbGciOiJIUzUxMiJ9.eyJzdWIiOiJqbTEwMjFAZ21haWwuY29tIiwiZXhwIjoxNjc1ODA0MTg2LCJpYXQiOjE2NzU3ODYxODZ9.rHoLxTcBJOBv36gH5qNI1VhgGv2Jub1OPtpddf1-fHd84BcL5MeGxiBhi2M0MpEJcuhTjeC2TYWVaOjT7ek0tg; Path=/; Max-Age=3600; Expires=Tue, 07 Feb 2023 17:09:46 GMT; Secure; HttpOnly; SameSite=None; Secure | . | The server verifies the JWT and, if it is valid, allows the request to proceed. Here is successful response. | . | The JWT consists of three parts, separated by dots (.). The first part is the header, which specifies the algorithm used to sign the JWT (e.g., HS256). The second part is the payload, which contains the claims. The third part is the signature, which is used to verify that the sender of the JWT is who it claims to be and to ensure that the message wasn’t changed along the way. . It is important to use HTTPS when transmitting JWTs to ensure that the JWT is not intercepted by an attacker. It is also a good idea to use short-lived JWTs (e.g., with an expiration time of one hour) and to refresh them frequently to reduce the risk of unauthorized access. . Storing JWT . There are a few different options for storing a JWT in a JavaScript application: . Cookies: You can store the JWT in a cookie and send it back to the server with each request. This is a simple and widely-supported option, but it has some limitations. For example, you can’t access cookies from JavaScript on a different domain, and some users may have cookies disabled in their browser settings. | Local storage: You can store the JWT in the browser’s local storage (localStorage) or session storage (sessionStorage). This option allows you to access the JWT from JavaScript on the same domain, but it is vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, where an attacker can inject malicious code into your application and steal the JWT from the storage. | HttpOnly cookie: You can store the JWT in an HttpOnly cookie, which is a cookie that can only be accessed by the server and not by client-side JavaScript. This option provides some protection against XSS attacks, but it is still vulnerable to other types of attacks, such as cross-site request forgery (CSRF). | ChatGPT says … It is generally recommended to use a combination of options to provide the best security for your application. For example, you could store the JWT in an HttpOnly cookie and also in local storage, and use JavaScript to send the JWT from local storage to the server with each request. This way, you can still access the JWT from JavaScript on the same domain, while also protecting against XSS attacks. . However, for this implementation we have used ** #3 HttpOnly Cookie **. . Key Configuration Areas . Nginx configuration snippet (Client to this Server): . Nginx. Focus on add_header in preflight that allow cross domain (github.io) to access server. java location / { proxy_pass http://localhost:8085; . # Preflighted requests if ($request_method = OPTIONS ) { add_header &quot;Access-Control-Allow-Credentials&quot; &quot;true&quot;; add_header &quot;Access-Control-Allow-Origin&quot; &quot;https://myserver.github.io&quot;; add_header &quot;Access-Control-Allow-Methods&quot; &quot;GET, POST, OPTIONS, HEAD&quot;; add_header &quot;Access-Control-Allow-MaxAge&quot; 600; add_header &quot;Access-Control-Allow-Headers&quot; &quot;Content-Type, Authorization, x-csrf-token&quot;; return 200; } } . Java JWT / Authenticate API . Java. Focus on the response ResponseCookie to see type, path, age, and allowing for cross-origin (sameSite). . @PostMapping(&quot;/authenticate&quot;) public ResponseEntity&lt;?&gt; createAuthenticationToken(@RequestBody Person authenticationRequest) throws Exception { authenticate(authenticationRequest.getEmail(), authenticationRequest.getPassword()); final UserDetails userDetails = personDetailsService .loadUserByUsername(authenticationRequest.getEmail()); final String token = jwtTokenUtil.generateToken(userDetails); final ResponseCookie tokenCookie = ResponseCookie.from(&quot;jwt&quot;, token) .httpOnly(true) .secure(true) .path(&quot;/&quot;) .maxAge(3600) .sameSite(&quot;None; Secure&quot;) // .domain(&quot;example.com&quot;) // Set to backend domain .build(); return ResponseEntity.ok().header(HttpHeaders.SET_COOKIE, tokenCookie.toString()).build(); } .

Authenticate with JWT in a JavaScript application: . This example sends a POST request to the /authorize endpoint with the user’s credentials in the request body. If the login was successful, the server will return a 200 OK response with the JWT set to Application properties. . /// URL for deployment var url = &quot;https://spring.nighthawkcodingsociety.com&quot; // Comment out next line for local testing // url = &quot;http://localhost:8085&quot; // Authenticate endpoint const login_url = url + &#39;/authenticate&#39;; function login_user(){ // Set body to include login data const body = { email: document.getElementById(&quot;uid&quot;).value, password: document.getElementById(&quot;password&quot;).value, }; // Set Headers to support cross origin const requestOptions = { method: &#39;POST&#39;, mode: &#39;cors&#39;, // no-cors, *cors, same-origin cache: &#39;no-cache&#39;, // *default, no-cache, reload, force-cache, only-if-cached credentials: &#39;include&#39;, // include, *same-origin, omit body: JSON.stringify(body), headers: { &quot;content-type&quot;: &quot;application/json&quot;, }, }; // Fetch JWT fetch(login_url, requestOptions) .then(response =&gt; { // trap error response from Web API if (!response.ok) { const errorMsg = &#39;Login error: &#39; + response.status; console.log(errorMsg); return; } // Success!!! // Redirect to Database location window.location.href = &quot;/APCSA/data/database&quot;; }) } . You can then use the JWT for authentication in subsequent fetch requests as the browser sends JWT in the Authorization header. Here is an example, but there is ** Nothing Unique ** in this example. . // prepare HTML result container for new output const resultContainer = document.getElementById(&quot;result&quot;); // prepare URL var url = &quot;https://spring.nighthawkcodingsociety.com/api/person/&quot;; // Uncomment next line for localhost testing // url = &quot;http://localhost:8085/api/person/&quot;; // set options for cross origin header request const options = { method: &#39;GET&#39;, // *GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc. mode: &#39;cors&#39;, // no-cors, *cors, same-origin cache: &#39;default&#39;, // *default, no-cache, reload, force-cache, only-if-cached credentials: &#39;include&#39;, // include, *same-origin, omit headers: { &#39;Content-Type&#39;: &#39;application/json&#39;, }, }; // fetch the API fetch(url, options) // response is a RESTful &quot;promise&quot; on any successful fetch .then(response =&gt; { // check for response errors and display if (response.status !== 200) { const errorMsg = &#39;Database response error: &#39; + response.status; console.log(errorMsg); const tr = document.createElement(&quot;tr&quot;); const td = document.createElement(&quot;td&quot;); td.innerHTML = errorMsg; tr.appendChild(td); resultContainer.appendChild(tr); return; } // valid response will contain json data response.json().then(data =&gt; { console.log(data); for (const row of data) { // tr and td build out for each row const tr = document.createElement(&quot;tr&quot;); const name = document.createElement(&quot;td&quot;); const id = document.createElement(&quot;td&quot;); const age = document.createElement(&quot;td&quot;); // data is specific to the API name.innerHTML = row.name; id.innerHTML = row.email; age.innerHTML = row.age; // this build td&#39;s into tr tr.appendChild(name); tr.appendChild(id); tr.appendChild(age); // add HTML to container resultContainer.appendChild(tr); } }) }) // catch fetch errors (ie ACCESS to server blocked) .catch(err =&gt; { console.error(err); const tr = document.createElement(&quot;tr&quot;); const td = document.createElement(&quot;td&quot;); td.innerHTML = err + &quot;: &quot; + url; tr.appendChild(td); resultContainer.appendChild(tr); }); .

            "title": "JWT Tokens Implementation",
            "content": "The Code . JWT | SecurityConfig | . Simple Explanation of each java file . A majority of the code was taken from https://www.javainuse.com/spring/boot-jwt. The new dependencies we need is in this Commit. This site provided the basic code needed to generate a jwt token and how we would configure the backend to require authorization when accessing a page. (Commit1 &amp; Commit2). . JwtTokenUtil.java, just like its name, contains utilities/functions that is needed to generate JWT tokens and get information like the email from the JWT tokens which is needed for making sure the JWT token is valid. . JWTUserDetailsService.java implements the Spring Security UserDetailsService interface and overrides the loadUserByUsername so we can later get user details from the database using the username. . The name JwtAuthenticationController.java on the article was changed to JwtApiController.java to fit the already existing API controllers and this creates an API endpoint of /authenticate which validates that the given email and password in the body is validate and then generates a JWT token for the credentials if it was valid. . We did not need the JwtRequest.java because it is used to store each user as an object and that is the Person class we’ve already coded. We also do not need JwtResponse.java. . The JwtRequestFilter.java extends the Spring Web Filter OncePerRequestFilter class and overrides the doFilterInternal function so each request sent to the server is processed through the function. The function checks if the JWT token is valid and sets the Authentication in the context to specify that the current user is authenticated. . JwtAuthenticationEntryPoint.java implements AuthenticationEntryPoint and overrides the commence function to specify what to do when a user was not authenticated, which is to return an unauthorized error. . WebSecurityConfig.java is our existing SecurityConfig.java. It extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter and overrides configure to allow /authenticate to not need the request be authenticated because /authenticate is where you generate the JWT token is get authenticated, add the jwtRequestFilter.java filter to validate the token with every request, and configure other features of web security like a stateless session. This can also be used to allow specific roles when that is configured (as seen in last year’s csa project). . Bigger changes differing from the article . JWTUserDetailsService.java was changed from the article because we already have a database storing users while the article hardcoded a user and password because it did not. . In the article, it assumed that our passwords stored inside the database was already encrypted using bcrypt, therefore, we have to configure /post to encrypt the passwords when adding users (Commit). . Since the article coded for /authenticate to return the JWT token inside its body, the frontend would have to take the JWT token and configure it into the browser. This would be susceptible to Cross Site Scripting Attacks. We can avoid forcing the frontend’s javascript to set the cookie by coding for /authenticate api’s response to automatically set the browser’s cookies with the JWT token using the Set-Cookie header. For this part, I followed along with https://reflectoring.io/spring-boot-cookies/ and made some changes to JwtApiController.java. Now the request sent by the browser would contain the JWT token using a HttpOnly cookie, so we have to code JwtRequestFilter.java so it gets the JWT token from the request’s Cookie header instead of its Authorization header (Commit). . Testing . Postman Testing . Using the existing account’s credentials test2@gmail.com and test2 to generate JWT Token through /authenticate. . Trying to access /api/person/ without jwt token stored in Cookies . Trying to access /api/person/ with a wrong jwt token stored in Cookies . Trying to access /api/person/ with a jwt token that does not have the signature . Accessing /api/person/ with generated jwt token stored in Cookies header . Testing the use of cookies in Chrome console . At first, when you access http://localhost:8085/, it will return a 401 Unauthorized error because you do not have a jwt cookie. We can use Chrome console with fetch to model what a frontend would do, set data = {email:&quot;toby@gmail.com&quot;, password:&quot;123Toby!&quot;}; then fetch(&quot;http://localhost:8085/authenticate&quot;, {method: &#39;POST&#39;, headers: {&#39;Content-Type&#39;: &#39;application/json&#39;}, body: JSON.stringify(data)});: Notice how we have a jwt cookie now Reload and http://localhost:8085/ should load without 401 error . What’s next . Roles can also be implemented next based on the old csa project and an actual frontend would be great. .",

            "content": "Security Concepts . Last year Teacher spent time in Spring Security System for csa.nighthawkcodingsociety.com. The implementation allows users (Person POJO) to login with specific roles (Role POJO). Two roles are present currently, ROLE_ADMIN and ROLE_STUDENT. In this implementation the ROLE_STUDENT is NOT able to delete users, you must be ROLE_ADMIN to perform this task. . Teacher took inspiration form YouTube. This video covers the detail shared below in about 2 hours. . My issue with this starter code is I never had time to get to JWT and do not have a true web implementation. Some thoughts the Teacher has on that topic are in JWT tech talk, most of the info is courtesy of ChatGPT. . Main Ideas . Spring Security Code is focused in these areas: Database Folder, Security Folder, Login Page and Navbar fragment. . Backend - Using Spring Security to Protect Defining POJOs | Back End Spring Security Overrides to use Person and Role POJOs | Authentication (LOGIN), requiring login to access certain parts of site | Authorization (ROLE), differentiation of permission of ROLE_ADMIN and ROLE_ADMIN on | Training Spring Security to work with POJOs and Security Config | . | Frontend - Building Configuration and Overrides to support Spring Security Login Page (customizing your own) | Navbar with Control Login/Logout buttons | Error Page for 403 authorization failure | . | . Backend - Using Spring Security to Protect . The key work of the backend and Spring Security is to associate user (Person) and their (Roles) with access to Get and Post Mappings. Planning needs to go into your POJO to have role(s) associated with each person. . Person POJO with roles. . Observe Many to Many and role collection. . @Entity public class Person { // automatic unique identifier for Person record @Id @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.AUTO) private Long id; // email, password, roles are key to login and authentication @NotEmpty @Size(min=5) @Column(unique=true) @Email private String email; @NotEmpty private String password; // roles are stored in a &quot;related&quot; table @ManyToMany(fetch = EAGER) private Collection&lt;Role&gt; roles = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;(); ... } . Role POJO. . Contains String to store ROLE_ADMIN, ROLE_STUDENT as distinct rows. All users have ability to obtain the same roles as known by the system. . @Entity public class Role { @Id @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.AUTO) private Long id; @Column(unique=true) private String name; } . ###vBack End Code - Authentication and Authorization . SecurityConfig provided through Spring Security enables developer to Authorize and Authentication different portions of the site based on Login and Roles. Additionally, you are able to direct the next page on operations like login and logout. Review .antmatchers statements. This file is being established to support http for both Web viewing and API access. . protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception { //THis is going to be altered to use the JWT // security rules http .authorizeRequests() .antMatchers(POST, &quot;/api/person/post/**&quot;).hasAnyAuthority(&quot;ROLE_STUDENT&quot;) .antMatchers(DELETE, &quot;/api/person/delete/**&quot;).hasAnyAuthority(&quot;ROLE_ADMIN&quot;) .antMatchers(&quot;/database/personupdate/**&quot;).hasAnyAuthority(&quot;ROLE_STUDENT&quot;) .antMatchers(&quot;/database/persondelete/**&quot;).hasAnyAuthority(&quot;ROLE_ADMIN&quot;) .antMatchers( &quot;/api/person/**&quot;).permitAll() .antMatchers( &quot;/api/refresh/token/**&quot;).permitAll() .antMatchers(&quot;/&quot;, &quot;/starters/**&quot;, &quot;/frontend/**&quot;, &quot;/mvc/**&quot;, &quot;/database/person/**&quot;, &quot;/database/personcreate&quot;, &quot;/database/scrum/**&quot;, &quot;/course/**&quot;).permitAll() .anyRequest().authenticated() .and() .formLogin() .loginPage(&quot;/login&quot;) .permitAll() .and() .logout() .logoutRequestMatcher(new AntPathRequestMatcher(&quot;/logout&quot;)) .logoutSuccessUrl(&quot;/database/person&quot;) .permitAll() ; // Cross-Site Request Forgery needs to be disabled to allow activation of JS Fetch URIs http.csrf().disable(); } . Backend Code - Training Spring Security to work with POJO and Security Config . ModelRepo implements UserDetailsService. This associates user (Person) and roles (Role) with Spring Security as you can see with return values from method. . public class ModelRepository implements UserDetailsService . /* UserDetailsService Overrides and maps Person &amp; Roles POJO into Spring Security */ @Override public org.springframework.security.core.userdetails.UserDetails loadUserByUsername(String email) throws UsernameNotFoundException { Person person = personJpaRepository.findByEmail(email); // setting variable user equal to the method finding the username in the database if(person==null){ throw new UsernameNotFoundException(&quot;User not found in database&quot;); } Collection&lt;SimpleGrantedAuthority&gt; authorities = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;(); person.getRoles().forEach(role -&gt; { //loop through roles authorities.add(new SimpleGrantedAuthority(role.getName())); //create a SimpleGrantedAuthority by passed in role, adding it all to the authorities list, list of roles gets past in for spring security }); return new org.springframework.security.core.userdetails.User(person.getEmail(), person.getPassword(), authorities); } . Password Encryption. (BCrypt) is also managed with this file . // Setup Password style for Database storing and lookup @Autowired // Inject PasswordEncoder private PasswordEncoder passwordEncoder; @Bean // Sets up password encoding style PasswordEncoder passwordEncoder(){ return new BCryptPasswordEncoder(); } . Password is encoded before JPA save. Spring Security does decoding within its system, later we will build login to send user and password to Spring Security. . public void save(Person person) { person.setPassword(passwordEncoder.encode(person.getPassword())); personJpaRepository.save(person); } . Frontend - Building Configuration and Overrides to support Spring Security . Login Page (customizing your own). If you override the form, it needs to be built returning a username and password. The override was setup in MvcConfig. The purpose of override is so it follows Style guideline from the site. . &lt;form name=&quot;f&quot; th:action=&quot;@{/login}&quot; method=&quot;POST&quot;&gt; &lt;table&gt; &lt;tr th:if=&quot;${param.error}&quot; class=&quot;alert alert-error&quot;&gt; Invalid username and password. &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;tr th:if=&quot;${param.logout}&quot; class=&quot;alert alert-success&quot;&gt; You have been logged out. &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;!-- &#39;email&#39; is mapped to &#39;username&#39; for Spring Security --&gt; &lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;&lt;label for=&quot;username&quot;&gt;Email&lt;/label&gt;&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt; &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;email&quot; id=&#39;username&#39; name=&quot;username&quot; size=&quot;20&quot; required&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt; &lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;&lt;label for=&quot;password&quot;&gt;Password&lt;/label&gt;&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt; &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;password&quot; id=&quot;password&quot; name=&quot;password&quot; size=&quot;20&quot; required&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt; &lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;submit&quot; value=&quot;Submit&quot;&gt;&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt; &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a th:href=&quot;@{/database/personcreate}&quot;&gt;Sign Up&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt; &lt;/table&gt; . Navbar Customizations. Using Thymeleaf and Spring Security the Navbar toggles between Login/Logout based off of Spring Security status. . &lt;!-- Login/Logout --&gt; &lt;th:block sec:authorize=&quot;isAnonymous()&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;px-3&quot;&gt; &lt;a th:href=&#39;@{/login}&#39; class=&quot;link-dark&quot;&gt;Login&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/th:block&gt; &lt;th:block sec:authorize=&quot;isAuthenticated()&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;px-3&quot;&gt; &lt;a th:href=&#39;@{/logout}&#39; class=&quot;link-dark&quot;&gt;Logout&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/th:block&gt; . Authorization error - 403. Following standard of 404 errors, a 403 page is inserted to provide better user experience versus Spring Boot error page. 403.html. Main purpose of this page is to direct the user back into the website with href. . &lt;div class=&quot;jumbotron jumbotron-fluid&quot; style=&quot;text-align: center; &quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;You don&#39;t have permission to do that!

Hacks . This blog adds to the concept of persistent data for a Person POJO. As it is focused on building a relational table for Notes to Person. Notes supports text/markdown/html rendering. Annotations and Hibernate are used. Explore and build other options for your tables and relationships. FYI, there is even inheritance in POJOs. You will learn a lot about Java if you explore with true PBL mindset. . Requirement for Project Make sure that Database is constructed | Have many tables in the Database | Build relationships in tables, ie Person has many Notes | Establish Roles in accessing data (ie Delete is only done by ADMIN) | . | Expectations of learnings form this Tech Talk Create a POJO with Many-to-One relationship | Build JPA to access all elements from and ID | Establish Controller methods and APIs, Build Frontend with JavaScript | Extra Credit, Build Admin Frontend with Thymeleaf | . | .",

            "content": "User Experience Design . At Qualcomm, I was involved in projects related to Customer Experience. In this design phase, Corporate User Experience designers would create concepts of what that system would look like. As a second phase, I would give those concepts to Frontend Designers that would put the concepts into code with motion. We are trying to simulate these steps through Markdown, a little HTML, images, etc. In this process, we can build a concept of a system, prior to having functional code behind the scenes, aka JavaScript, APIs, Backend. | . Build GitHub pages SASS files . Build and explore the output of scss. . | Build per instruction in Project README bundle exec jekyll serve -H 0.0.0.0 -P 4002 | . | After you do this, make sure .gitignore blocks ### Jekyll ### _site .sass-cache .jekyll-cache .jekyll-metadata . | Explore output CSS, for example look at customization for h1, h2, … _site/assets/css/style.css | . | Look at other assets, see all the work that goes into Style. Learn to leverage off of it. Learn to customize on top of it using SASS tips in the blog. | . Stylesheet Notes from Midnight Theme . Altering GitHub theme and adding custom styles: . Create a file called /assets/css/style.scss in your site | Add the following content to the top of the file, exactly as shown: @import &quot;minima&quot;; . | Add any custom CSS (or Sass, including imports) you’d like immediately after the @import line | Note: If you’d like to change the theme’s Sass variables, you must set new values before the @import line in your stylesheet. . Layouts Notes from Midnight Theme . If you’d like to change the theme’s HTML layout: . For some changes such as a custom favicon, you can add custom files in your local _includes folder. The files provided with the theme provide a starting point and are included by the original layout template. | For more extensive changes, copy the original template from the theme’s repository(Pro-tip: click “raw” to make copying easier) | Create a file called /_layouts/default.html in your site | Paste the default layout content copied in the first step | Customize the layout as you’d like | Welcome to SASS . SASS helps process a SASS file and compile it like the usual CSS file. Using SASS let’s us leverage off of a lot of implementation that has already been performed, such as GitHub pages. But it also lets you more programmatically build CSS. . . SASS Prerequisites . Skip downloads section unless you have issues. . Downloads / Command Prompt Lines . Check for npm --version to verify install, or download node.js here (just download the LTS version). . | This line of code is just used to check that you actually have npm installed, if not run installer : npm --version . | Next you will use check for sass : npm view sass version . | Install sass if required : npm install -g sass . | . SASS Tips . Features / Functionality . As the great thing about scss is that it writes the css for you, making it much less tedious. There are many aspects as to why it actually simplifies the process. | . Aspect 1: Partials . Sass naturally transpiles all the .scss files directly. However, when you want to import a file, you do not need the file to be transpiled directly. Sass has a mechanism for this: If you start the filename with an underscore, Sass will not transpile it. Files named this way are called partials and they allow you to work in a much more organized space. | . Aspect 2: Defining Colors / Variables . Rather than retyping the hexadecimal values of each color every single time, you can define all of the ones you want to use in a partial and then just reference them with $[color] when you want to use it. However, make sure you import the partial into the scss file where you are going to use it in. $light: #f7f7f7; $dark: #222121; $lime: #00cc66; $orangeRed: #fb4b4e; $blue: #2541b2; . | Example shown here: .navbar { background: $light; // see how instead of having to retype the hexadecimal, I can just reference it like this WOWOW so COOL height: 80px; display: flex; justify-content: space-between; padding: 0.5rem calc((100vw - 1200px) / 2); z-index: 10; position: relative; . | . Aspect 3: Nested Styling . Another unique aspect about scss is that you can actually nest styles, so if you want an aspect like let’s say color to apply to everything you are working on for that portion of the html, you can actually nest the rest of the formatting, animations, etc within that definition. | Implementation shown here with the Hero section in student scss: .hero { background-color: $light; // see how the rest of the code is indented / nested within .hero &amp;__container { display: grid; grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr; align-items: center; justify-items: center; margin: 0 auto; height: 90vh; z-index: 1; width: 100%; max-width: 1200px; padding-right: 24px; padding-left: 24px; @include tablet { // @include tablet and @include mobile will be explained next grid-template-columns: 1fr; height: 100%; } &amp;--left { width: 100%; line-height: 1.2; @include tablet { padding: 5rem 0; } @include mobile { line-height: 1.5; } } &amp;--left h1 { font-size: 4rem; color: $lime; @include mobile { font-size: 1.5rem; } } &amp;--left h2 { font-size: 4rem; color: $dark; @include mobile { font-size: 2rem; } } &amp;--left p { font-size: 2rem; color: $dark; margin-top: 1rem; font-weight: 700; @include mobile { font-size: 1.5rem; } } &amp;--btn { font-size: 1rem; background-color: $lime; padding: 14px 32px; border: none; border-radius: 4px; color: $light; margin-top: 2rem; cursor: pointer; position: relative; transition: all 0.3s; outline: none; } &amp;--btn a { position: relative; z-index: 2; color: $light; text-decoration: none; } &amp;--btn:after { // code animates home page button so that it transitions to red when hovered position: absolute; content: &#39;&#39;; top: 0; left: 0; width: 0; height: 100%; background: $orangeRed; transition: all 0.3s; border-radius: 4px; } &amp;--btn:hover:after { width: 100%; } &amp;--right { text-align: center; } &amp;--img { height: 100%; width: 100%; } } } . | You can see how this code works in tandem with the Hero section of the HTML, the class definitions are associated with every definition of styling coded above: | . &lt;!-- Hero HTML, each of the classes here correspond to what&#39;s defined above in the scss &lt;div class=&quot;hero&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;hero__container&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;hero__container--left&quot;&gt; &lt;h1&gt;College Apps Are Coming!&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Be Prepared&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sign up now to join the list.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;button class=&quot;hero__container--btn&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#&quot;&gt;Sign Up&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/button&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;hero__container--right&quot;&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;images/img-2.svg&quot; class=&quot;hero__container--img&quot; /&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; --&gt; . Aspect 4: Easily Change Formatting Based on Device . With the power of scss, you can more easily than ever change the formatting of your site based on which device a person is using. | Such can be done by defining the resolutions in a partial like here: | . &lt;!-- @mixin tablet { @media screen and (max-width: 768px) { @content; } } @mixin mobile { @media screen and (max-width: 280px) { @content; } } --&gt; . Then you can use @include to reference these resolutions and change the css/formatting based on the device like here: | . &amp;--left h1 { font-size: 4rem; color: $lime; @include mobile { // in this case the font size changes because it&#39;s mobile font-size: 1.5rem; } } &amp;--left h2 { font-size: 4rem; color: $dark; @include mobile { font-size: 2rem; } } . Aspect 5: Extending, Inheritance, and Calculations . In scss, you can also use @extend if you want certain classes to inherit attributes from previously defined classes, sort of similar to nesting inheritance (where the classes nested within inherit the attributes from outermost classes). An example is shown below: | . &lt;!-- %align-center { display: flex; align-items: center; } logo { color: $dark; cursor: pointer; text-decoration: none; font-size: 2rem; margin-left: 24px; @extend %align-center; //it&#39;s inheriting the above values for display and align:items } --&gt; . Furthermore, you can actually use math operators like multiplication, addition, subtraction and division in scss. In the code below I use it to extend the animation of a button: &amp;--btn:hover:after { width: 100% * 4; //makes the animation extend way farther, past the border of the button } . | .

Jobs . Quality 1st and Creativity/Features 2nd will be the keys to 2nd Trimester points. Each team role needs to establish goals. To improve software it is important that all parties in the project have full understanding of requirements through fluid communication channels. Thus, establishing a development plan is a requirement. Here are some ideas … . Feature Focus keep an up to date blog/readme on the features of your project. The focus is to have 4 to 5 major features and the team should keep an up to date status of the progress of those features. This includes how each feature meets all the criteria of College Board Create Task. | Scrum Master should have Team Member Issues and Customer/Teacher/Grader review ticket always in plan. The review ticket should line up with Quality and Feature Focus. Scrum Master maintain features/quality plan and holds team members accountable to plan. Think about Scrum Board, README, and Issues as key artifacts to plan. | DevOps should have CI/CD goals. Process should be able to identify failures when the occur and by what change. | Backend Developer should have tester methods that don’t depend on Frontend code or later CI/CD process to catch errors. Make sure key features are working in backend. | Frontend Developer should establish full system checks before reviews. Don’t be that guy that says, “it worked last time I tried it”. All system checks should be able to be performed on localhost frontend server. | . End with Comment Edits . Every person should modify their comment. . Take a moment to review standards linked on this page. Provide summary in comment on why information is this blog is important?. | Would you rather work on PBL project, or or do assigned free-response coding questions (aka FRQs)? Which would be easier to meet class standards? | Trust and Freedom are often earned. How will you show your passion and ability to succeed in your work? | What key learnings and focusses are a priority for you? | . Hacks . Every Team should review comments, google agile manifesto, and then make a team manifesto. . In a manifesto you should have priority elements, as shown in this blogs image. | In a manifesto, have an element that tells team what is most important, have a supporting element that is less important but needed to support processes. | Have 3 to 5 lines in your manifesto. | .",

Below is a code segment that updates a clock on a page every second, adaptation would be to update data from API fetch on an interval, then updating all document elements after fetch. . // Clock Control // clockElement global element set for convenience let clockElement = document.getElementById(&#39;clock&#39;) // Execute clock function on load clock(); // Clock update executes on each interval set by timer function clock() { let date = new Date(); clockElement.textContent = date.toLocaleString(); } // Clock refresh timer, a reoccurring event setInterval(clock, 1000); . Step 2 - JavaScript update backend content . To make the updates document elements meaningful you would need to have an interval to update the Haha or Boohoo content. This could be done in same or different JavaScript timer. This would be calling appropriate fetch in add to the counters. Together, these would give the same effect as the World-O-Meter. . Step 2 (Java Option) - update backend content . Instead of having frontend update counter, you could have backend update the counter. The below python code could be adapted for Java. . import threading # import threading def keepUpdating(): # build a function to run over and over # global variable setup global run try: run except: run = 0 print(&quot;Seconds:&quot;, run) # replace this line with updates to data run += 3 # this is update to global variable threading.Timer(3.0, keepUpdating).start() keepUpdating() # you need to call this function at application startup . Step 2 (Bash Option) - do updates on server . Update content using curl and scheduling on the system. To make a PUT request with Curl, you need to use the -X PUT command-line option. . $ curl -X PUT localhost:8080/api/like/1 . This command would need to be added to crontab or a bash script and crontab to run repeatedly. . $ crontab -l # Edit this file to introduce tasks to be run by cron. # # Each task to run has to be defined through a single line # indicating with different fields when the task will be run # and what command to run for the task .

            "content": "Runtime Link . Back-end Java Spring MVC Files . Java Database . A POJO is the foundation for making an Entity that is turned into a Database. The Java Persistent API (JPA) allows Developer to interact with the Database with fairly straightforward code. An API allows you to share and store data from your community of users. The pieces are described in this blog. . . POJO and @Entity Definition . This code shows power of Spring Annotations and Java, with a little bit of code a Developer is opening up persistent data storage, a database. . import lombok.AllArgsConstructor; import lombok.Data; import lombok.NoArgsConstructor; import javax.persistence.*; @Data // Annotations to simplify writing code (ie constructors, setters) @NoArgsConstructor @AllArgsConstructor @Entity // Annotation to simplify creating an entity, which is a lightweight persistence domain object. Typically, an entity represents a table in a relational database, and each entity instance corresponds to a row in that table. public class Jokes { @Id @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.AUTO) private Long id; // Unique identifier @Column(unique=true) private String joke; // The Joke private int haha; // Store joke likes private int boohoo; // Store joke jeers } . Java Persistence API (JPA) . The JPA is created to access the database. The JokesJpaRepository interface extends JpaRepository. This allows the developer access predefined and additionally define useful interfaces to access their persistent storage. . import java.util.List; import org.springframework.data.jpa.repository.JpaRepository; // JPA is an object-relational mapping (ORM) to persistent data, originally relational databases (SQL). Today JPA implementations has been extended for NoSQL. public interface JokesJpaRepository extends JpaRepository&lt;Jokes, Long&gt; { // JPA has many built in methods, these few have been prototyped for this application void save(String Joke); // A List&lt;Jokes&gt; findAllByOrderByJokeAsc(); // returns a List of Jokes in Ascending order List&lt;Jokes&gt; findByJokeIgnoreCase(String joke); // look to see if Joke(s) exist } . List and ArrayList . List is a super class to ArrayList. This illustration shows relationship. In the JPA code you can see that List of Jokes is common result from JPA. As a database is a series of rows, accessing a List or and ArrayList is done through similar iteration. Here is illustration of List and ArrayList from GeeksForGeeks . . Controller and APIs . The last backend piece of the process of accessing the database is building out the RESTful API services to access the data. Below is the JokesApiController, this is commented extensively. This has many AP and PBL elements. . @Autowired annotation provides full access to JokesJpaRepository, what we made with the code above. Review repository., there are actions for set, get, save and more. | @GetMapping and @PutMapping which establishes endpoints for RESTful web services to access the data. | API data structuring elements @PathVariable and “return new ResponseEntity” these are keys for obtaining and returning data from the accessor. | . import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired; import org.springframework.http.HttpStatus; import org.springframework.http.ResponseEntity; import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.*; import java.util.List; import java.util.Optional; @RestController // annotation to simplify the creation of RESTful web services @RequestMapping(&quot;/api/jokes&quot;) // all requests in file begin with this URI public class JokesApiController { // Autowired enables Control to connect URI request and POJO Object to easily for Database CRUD operations @Autowired private JokesJpaRepository repository; /* GET List of Jokes * @GetMapping annotation is used for mapping HTTP GET requests onto specific handler methods. */ @GetMapping(&quot;/&quot;) public ResponseEntity&lt;List&lt;Jokes&gt;&gt; getJokes() { // ResponseEntity returns List of Jokes provide by JPA findAll() return new ResponseEntity&lt;&gt;( repository.findAll(), HttpStatus.OK); } /* Update Like * @PutMapping annotation is used for mapping HTTP PUT requests onto specific handler methods. * @PathVariable annotation extracts the templated part {id}, from the URI */ @PutMapping(&quot;/like/{id}&quot;) public ResponseEntity&lt;Jokes&gt; setLike(@PathVariable long id) { /* * Optional (below) is a container object which helps determine if a result is present. * If a value is present, isPresent() will return true * get() will return the value. */ Optional&lt;Jokes&gt; optional = repository.findById(id); if (optional.isPresent()) { // Good ID Jokes joke = optional.get(); // value from findByID joke.setHaha(joke.getHaha()+1); // increment value repository.save(joke); // save entity return new ResponseEntity&lt;&gt;(joke, HttpStatus.OK); // OK HTTP response: status code, headers, and body } // Bad ID return new ResponseEntity&lt;&gt;(HttpStatus.BAD_REQUEST); // Failed HTTP response: status code, headers, and body } /* Update Jeer */ @PutMapping(&quot;/jeer/{id}&quot;) public ResponseEntity&lt;Jokes&gt; setJeer(@PathVariable long id) { Optional&lt;Jokes&gt; optional = repository.findById(id); if (optional.isPresent()) { // Good ID Jokes joke = optional.get(); joke.setBoohoo(joke.getBoohoo()+1); repository.save(joke); return new ResponseEntity&lt;&gt;(joke, HttpStatus.OK); } // Bad ID return new ResponseEntity&lt;&gt;(HttpStatus.BAD_REQUEST); } } . Front End . This database was setup to allow people to HaHa or Boohoo a collection of Computer Jokes. The entirety has lot of limitation. . People can vote more than once and in both categories. | There is no auto refresh if several are voting and updating as you are looking at your static page. | Perhaps Q and A style could hide punch line. | Perhaps we could accept new jokes, or have interface for adding them. | . Amazingly, though … the front-end code is in a completely different project. The front end project GETs and PUTs using the back end APIs. The key element that makes this different than other public APIs, like RapidAPI, is the “reaction” function. This function updates the elementID of the like or jeer as soon as you impact the button. . Frontend JavaScript Code . // Reaction function to likes or jeers user actions function reaction(type, put_url, elemID) { // fetch the API fetch(put_url, put_options) // response is a RESTful &quot;promise&quot; on any successful fetch .then(response =&gt; { // check for response errors if (response.status !== 200) { error(&quot;PUT API response failure: &quot; + response.status) return; // api failure } // valid response will have JSON data response.json().then(data =&gt; { console.log(data); // Likes or Jeers updated/incremented if (type === HAHA) // like data element document.getElementById(elemID).innerHTML = data.haha; // fetched haha data assigned to haha Document Object Model (DOM) else if (type === BOOHOO) // jeer data element document.getElementById(elemID).innerHTML = data.boohoo; // fetched boohoo data assigned to boohoo Document Object Model (DOM) else error(&quot;unknown type: &quot; + type); // should never occur }) }) // catch fetch errors (ie Nginx ACCESS to server blocked) .catch(err =&gt; { error(err + &quot; &quot; + put_url); }); } . Hacks . AP required. Review the lambok annotations (https://projectlombok.org/features/). . Write the POJO without using lambok | . PBL foundational. Establish a POJO, JPA and APIs in your own project. You can begin with Jokes. . Make new POJO attribute. FYI, as there is not database upgrade.

            "title": "GitHub and Git Sociology",
            "content": ". GitHub and Git . GitHub.com was launched in April 2008 by Tom Preston-Werner, Chris Wanstrath, P. J. Hyett and Scott Chaco. GitHub is a subsidiary of Microsoft since 2018 (kind of ironic with Git quote below), but GitHub is not Git it helps manage the server or backend. . Linus Torvalds invented Linux and about 2005 invented Git. Quotes by Linus: . “Talk is cheap. Show me the code.” | “Most good programmers do programming not because they expect to get paid or get adulation by the public, but because it is fun to program.” | Microsoft isn’t evil; they just make really crappy operating systems. | . In our environments, Git is local and it works with GitHub/Git is in the cloud. Together these tools together have become an industry standard since about 2015. Formerly in industry we used tools like (ClearCase and Perforce), before the 90s we had home brewed systems. Kind of like making smart backups of files. . Terms and Usage . A brief review of key commands and concepts. . A “git clone” makes a local Git repository (decentralized) from the cloud server (GitHub/Git). | A .git directory contains a local database (see illustration) that keeps track of local changes. | A “git commit” makes a child snapshot of the original parent on the local database. Git commits over time are a series of Secure Hashing Algorithms (SHA’s). This is the math behind a git snapshot. | The .gitignore file tells .git to ignore certain files in directory tree (ie files constructed from source or derived files, like ipynb files that turn into md files). | The “git push” command moves files from local system back to cloud server (GitHub). However, often a merge is required as the decentralized system can have many simultaneous contributors. Students will experience this when they share a repository. | To minimize conflicts, Developers use Git branches and/or GitHub Forks to push code to an isolated locations on the server/cloud. This simply delays the inevitable merge, but has benefit of keeping developers branch of project stable. | Pull requests is common process used to merge code from isolated Fork back to the primary GitHub repository. | A “git rebase” is a common command for Developer on an isolated Git branch to update their environment from the “main” branch. Often this is done prior to a “git push” back the “main” branch. | . Project Based Learning . In Project Based Learning, it is required that you have a policy on Contributing Guidelines. Many student have already experienced problems of merging and managing change, by editing code GitHub directly, while editing code on VSCode locally. This will be an every day occurrence when starting a GitHub/Git sociology. Thus, teams need to create a policy to communicate how Scrum Team or Others should contribute to your project. . GitHub and VSCode | . Hacks . Any sociology questions within team need to be answered with a Blog, A Scrum Master working with other Developers should establish the Github administration/sociology policies: . What is the main repository for your project? | Did you create a .gitignore to avoid committing files that ‘don’t belong in version control? Look at this tool for guidance. | Have you established Issues as part of your Development process? Creating Issues | Have you considered making Pull Requests to track development? Create Pull Request | Have you considered forks or branching techniques with pull requests? Link Issue to PR | Are you managing Issues on a Project Board/Scrum Board like Kanban?

            "content": "What Are VPN’s? . Virtual Private Networks, or VPNs establish a protected network connection when using public networks. VPNs encrypt your internet traffic and disguise your online identity. This makes it more difficult for third parties to track your activities online and steal data. . How Does A VPN Work . A VPN hides your IP address by letting the network redirect it through a specially configured remote server run by a VPN host. This means that if you surf online with a VPN, the VPN server becomes the source of your data. This means your Internet Service Provider (ISP) and other third parties cannot see which websites you visit or what data you send and receive online, and which can only be accessed if one’s VPN gets hacked; however, that is extremely unlikely to happen because VPN’s are very securely encrypted. A VPN works like a filter that turns all your data into “gibberish”. Even if someone were to get their hands on your data, it would be useless. . Setting Up A VPN (MacOS) . Navigate to your browser and search for a VPN and follow the websites directions for installation | Go to “System Preferences” and then “Network” | Click on the plus sign in the bottom left corner and use the drop-down menu to choose your VPN | Fill in the details for your chosen VPN in the fields “VPN Type” and “Service Name” | Create a new VPN network and fill in your “Server Address,” “Remote ID” and “Local ID” | Enter “Authentication Settings” and add your username and password | Click “OK” and Connect your VPN | Setting Up A VPN (Windows) . Navigate to your browser and search for a VPN and follow the websites directions for installation | Move into “Settings” and click on “Network” and then “VPN” | Click “Add a VPN” and fill out the fields for “Server Name,” “VPN Type” and your account information, which should be shared by the VPN provider you chose | Save your VPN | Go back into “VPN,” click on your newly added account and press “Connect” | Using A VPN . There are a host of different reasons to use a VPN. Below, I have listed a few reasons to sue a VPN . Make public Wi-Fi more secure | Protect your mobile devices | Hide your IP address | Data Privacy From Your Internet Service Provider | Data Privacy From the Apps and Services You Use | Access to Any Content in Any Place (Streaming shows that are on other countries Netflix) | Les likely to get hacked | . Recommended Software (Free) . Proton VPN Free | Privado VPN | Windscribe | Atlas VPN | Hide.me | Betternet (500 MB per day, as long as you don’t overuse data for one day which is extremely unlikely to happen) | .

Look for a real need, Teacher/Student need, Educational Study or Simulation, Campus Club, Campus Interest, Business Interest, Charitable Organization, mimic portions of a system like Amazon, etc. Of course, the greatest interest is Student Interest. The project will not work if only one student is interested. - Program Purpose and Function. Think about inputs, outputs, UI, and data that will be in the program. - Be sure to pick something that you don’t burn out on after a couple of weeks. If you are a couple days into something and it is not working it is best to change. - IMO, it is much more interesting to work on something that has 3rd party interest or that you design something with intention to acquire a 3rd party interest. Working on something to acquire accolades is a big motivator. . Begin a code base. Some of ideation may come in play with code. This could also be done in Jupyter Notebooks. | Data Abstraction. UML is pictured in article. Think about how data will be formed and managed. | Managing Complexity. Think about frontend and backend portions of the system.

This should help you divide work amongst team. Effectually, you will be creating the sub systems of the system in this design effort. | Algorithm Implementation. The key aspects of your project and its algorithms must be considered and prototyped early. This will help you understand capabilities of team and some of the longer/research required activities. | Testing. Be sure that you are performing iteration and testing as you go. Do not stack things up or integrate infrequently. Develop, Integrate, Test a couple of times weekly!!! Also, think about the things that needs to be tested.

Service in deployment will cache these files for quick loading over the internet. | static/sccs - these are cached as well. This location and the sccs name state this will work with node tools. The standard is called Sassy and is the same as used in Python Flask projects. | templates/error - error pages can be placed here. Can you guess were you would put a 500 error page. | application.properties - this resource is used to define defaults for the application. Most of these default are used by backed, for instance this will be used to define location of a database. This is similar to __init__.py. | . .",

To ensure transparency during the sprint the Team should meet daily at the daily scrum ( sometimes called a standup). As adaptation for classroom, Team should have a standup meeting for weekly plans, should have assignments for tasks, assignments for integration and deployment. . Scrum Master: The scrum master helps to facilitate the sprint by ensuring that an agile framework is followed. He/she is committed to tracking issues and maintaining scrum boards, but should also remain flexible and open to opportunities for the team to improve their workflow. | DevOps: DevOps is the combination of cultural philosophies, practices, and tools that increases an team’s ability to deliver applications and services at high velocity: version control, integration, managing dependencies, POM file management, AWS deployment are some of the key functions that impact velocity. | Development Team: The development team can be comprised of all kinds of people including designers, writers, presenters, developers, etc. Two key roles in Web Development are … Frontend Developer: A front-end developer builds the front-end portion of websites and web applications—that is, the part that users actually see and interact with. | Backend Developer: Back-end developers a build and maintain the mechanisms that process data and perform actions like data storage, security, and other server-side functions that you cannot see. | . | . Workload . When planning there is an expectation of time. . Individual in Class Time. You should expect 3 to 4 hours of productive classroom work each week. | Individual at Home Time. To maintain pace in this class, you should consider a 2 hour coding or design session (weekly) outside of class time. | Sprint Calculation Time. 5-6 hours of coding or planning per week per individual, or 20-24 hours per team.

This includes planning, research, development, deployment, and test. Typically, sprints will be 2 weeks or longer in the classroom. Anytime a sprint lasts longer than a week, there will be a weekly Review Tickets (formative assessment) and concluding with an end of Review Ticket (summative assessment). Sample sprint follows… . Week 1 Monday - Sprint Objectives, Scrum Team Planning | Tuesday - Test Prep Tuesday (Student Led) | Wednesday - Code, Code, Code | Thursday - Tech Talk (Teacher) | Friday - Code, Code, Code; Teacher 1 v 2, formative review | 2 hours outside of class for project work | . | Week 2 Monday - Sprint Crossover Grading, Scrum Team Planning | Tuesday - Test Prep Tuesday (Student Led) | Wednesday - Code, Code, Code | Thursday - Tech Talk (Teacher) | Friday - Code, Code, Code; Teacher 1 v 4 including Demos/Review Ticket/Peer, summative review | 2 hours outside of class for project work | . | . 7 Important Transferable Skills . Assessments / Reviews . During Teacher reviews meetings ( 1 v 2 pair, 1 v 4 team), the pair or team will provide Teacher with an Issues that that will be called a Review Ticket. The issue will be completed, it will reference Tasks Completed and Self/Crossover Score(s). Canvas should be used as a guide to completing a review ticket, make sure you account for everything. Make sure Point total is a the top of ticket, if points are important to you! All assessments will be looking for these 7 elements in your work… . Creativity Creativity doesn’t necessarily mean you paint or draw or sculpt well. Creativity in education and workplace, in many cases, presents itself in terms of how you approach tasks and solve problems, Do you both inside and outside of the box for solutions? Or, do you stick to a planned system? If you solve even the smallest problem, you’ve demonstrated creativity. This skill scales up: Big problems are enlarged small problems; small problems scaled are big problems. Conceptualize problems and solutions | Display foresight | Make connections | Make intelligent inferences | Synthesize ideas and data | . | Critical thinking Solving complex or abstract problems requires critical thinking, especially when the problems are critical. Not only that, but critical thinking skills also enable the discovery of deficiencies that could cause less than optimal results. The ability to take a step back and look at things more critically and say ‘Where might we have to have gotten this wrong?’ or ‘How might we be able to improve this?’ is critical thinking. IIf you can articulate this skill you will stand out! | Critical thinkers head off problems before they arise. And if they do surface, they take them head-on. | . | Communication Effective communication is the crux of everything you do.. It doesn’t matter how creative or intelligent you are, or how many computer languages you know: If you can’t communicate well, your other skills are meaningless. Students are encouraged to talk about how they were able to bring their teams together. Verbal skills. How do you address an audience in terms they can understand. | Listening skills. Learning and understanding without defensiveness. | Writing skills. You need to be able to write in such a way that non-experts will understand. | Technological communication skills. You should be able to discuss highly technical hard skills in a way appropriate to your audience. Communication details are not the same for all audiences. | . | Collaboration through Leadership Leadership skills generally encompass communication, problem-solving and managing conflict, relationship building and being able to get people on your team on board with a mission or project. Leaders are big-picture thinkers who take various interests into account when making major decisions. Leaders are responsible for: Delegating responsibility | Demonstrating effective time management | Initiating new ideas | Major decision-making | Managing conflict | Managing groups | Multitasking | Teaching and mentoring | . | Collaboration - Teamwork Individuals that work well with others. This is a important category mentioned in early school. But it applies to High School, College and adults. Trust is the major difference between working alone versus working in groups. And trust can be hard: Some people are skeptical by nature or want to work through an entire project lifecycle solo. But placing trust in an active, dynamic team provides more than just project completion. Teamwork — a sense of community — elevates spirits and improves productivity. Accepting responsibility | Making and implementing decisions | Managing time wisely | Meeting both short- and long-term goals | Organizing | Setting and meeting deadlines | . | Researching Research is not a process performed by Teacher, Boss, or some upstream process. Everything you do in Technology requires research. Research is a key part of the lifecycle: changing plans, fluctuating results, and roadblocks require research before anyone can take action. Conversing with team members is a form of research: If you’ve asked a peer’s opinion on a technical matter, you’ve performed research. Analyzing information | Brainstorming solutions | Delineating needs and requirements | Extracting information from data | Gathering information | Forecasting possible roadblocks | Setting goals | Solving problems | . | Technical We live in a tech-heavy world, and you need to understand the tech your project requires. Try to stay current with the many technical advancements on your project. Make sure that play with the different softwares and platforms that are part of your environment.

            "content": "It’s often useful to test pages locally before deploying, as it can save time and be helpful for testing quick changes/debugging. In this blog we’ll learn how to deploy fastpages locally using Docker. . Overview of steps . Download Docker desktop | (For Windows) Set up Docker with WSL | Run make server in repo directory | Click in terminal or type localhost link show (ex. http://127.0.0.1:4000/{repo name}) to view your Fastpages Blog site. | 1. Installation . Docker is a lightweight method to build, deploy, run, update and manage containers. Download Docker desktop from following links: . Windows: https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/ Mac: https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/. . Now, each time you want to make server, you need to start Docker desktop or make sure it running. Make sure you do this before building locally! . 2. (For Windows) Set up Docker with WSL . For Windows, to set up Docker with WSL use https://docs.docker.com/desktop/windows/wsl/. . (Optional) Download Docker extension in VSCode . VSCode has an extension too make it easier to manage docker containers and images directly in your IDE. To download, go to the Extensions tab of VSCode (left bar, or Ctrl+Shift+X), search “Docker” and download the extension from Microsoft. You should now see a docker icon on the left bar, which you can click on to see your Docker connections. . 3. Using VSCode Terminal, run: make server . In the local repository, make sure you are cd’ed to the base/root directory (i.e. where the Makefile is). For Ellen that was the ap-csa-fastpages directory as pictured. For Mr M, cd ~/vscode/APCSA sets him in his APCSA repository, here the make server command will work if Docker is running. . . The Makefile contains common aliased commands for building and serving your fastpages locally. If you look inside the file or run make in terminal, you can see what docker commands it can run. . . Specifically, we are interested in the make server command, which will build the container the first time and start the Jekyll server. If you remember from APCSP, Jekyll is what powers Github pages behind the scenes. You can build your GitHub Pages site locally using Jekyll to preview and test changes to your site. . Special steps for Windows . The first time, you might get this issue: . . If that’s the case, make sure this setting is toggled on in Docker desktop settings: . . It should ask you to reload and if you run the command again it should work now. . 4. View blog . After running, look for link to run Server. For me, this was http://127.0.0.1:4000/{repo name}: . Server address: http://127.0.0.1:4000/ . Server running… press ctrl-c to stop. . Shift-click server address to launch in Browser. . Leave the server running!!! . Make edits in VSCode and save the file. On each save, watch terminal in VSCode to see updates and regeneration of WebSite. . Refresh or click to Web page of change and you will see updates almost instantly. Refer to VSCode terminal to see any error encountered when running your server. As indicated ctrl-c will stop the server, however, I have left it running for hours of edits, testing, and commits to GitHub. . Alert, when you are satisfied with local changes… you must ✔️Commit and Sync to GitHub. The local server is used to preview and test change prior to Sync. Only after Sync, will others be able to see your changes. . . Add to .gitignore . A side effect of building locally is that it converts all the .ipynb and .docx files to .md. This means that some files will have duplicates after building – one in .ipynb or .docx, another in .md form. . To avoid duplicates masters when pushing to github, add the md generated files from to the .gitignore. This can be done by right clicking md file when preparing commits. Below is a sample .gitignore. The 1st three lines should be universal to all fastpages projects, the other files are specific to your project. . # Ignore from local build settings.ini Gemfile.lock images/copied_from_nb/ _posts/2022-08-15-AP-anatomy.md _posts/2022-08-22-HM-anthony_and_sahil.md _posts/2022-08-22-TT-darkmode.md _posts/2022-08-22-AP-primitives.md _posts/2022-08-22-TT-bash_tutorial.md _posts/2022-08-29-AP-using_java_objects.md _posts/2022-09-05-AP-boolean_ifs.md _posts/2022-09-19-TT-js_tutorial.md _posts/2022-09-26-TT-rapidapi.md .

Note the @GetMapping which is used to associate a Web URL (/birds) with a Java Method (public String birds()) . @Controller // HTTP requests are handled as a controller, using the @Controller annotation public class Birds { // CONTROLLER handles GET request for /birds, maps it to birds() method @GetMapping(&quot;/birds&quot;) public String birds() { // load HTML VIEW (birds.html) return &quot;birds&quot;; } } . Greet.java . Purpose of Greet is to allow user to change Hello, World! greeting. This page is VERY important to learn in order to master passing data from frontend to backend using @RequestParam with associated keys and values. The key “name” HTML input and is mapped to the Java using wrapper Class, String name. In the method, String name is made back into key value using model.addAttribute(“name”, name). In this example, nothing is altered in, but this provides feedback and response framework that can be used for more sophisticated applications. . @Controller // HTTP requests are handled as a controller, using the @Controller annotation public class Greet { // @GetMapping handles GET request for /greet, maps it to greeting() method @GetMapping(&quot;/greet&quot;) // @RequestParam handles variables binding to frontend, defaults, etc public String greeting(@RequestParam(name=&quot;name&quot;, required=false, defaultValue=&quot;World&quot;) String name, Model model) { // model attributes are visible to Thymeleaf when HTML is &quot;pre-processed&quot; model.addAttribute(&quot;name&quot;, name); // load HTML VIEW (greet.html) return &quot;greet&quot;; } } .

Deployment is the tools and service used to enable the Web Application on the Internet. The process of can use many different cloud servers, as well as choice in tools and services. . EC2: Amazon Web Services is a cloud computing platform that the PUSD district has provided for us to serve our Web Application. | GitHub: At this point in time, we should be aware that we are using GitHub is an open platform to share our Web Application code on the Internet. | Docker and docker-compose: To host a Web Application you need to prepare an environment that contains the Web Application code and all the dependencies (POM.xml for Java) Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications. | Nginx: To find a Web Application on a server, there needs to be a process to listen for the Web request and direct it to the Web Application. Nginx is an open source software for web serving, reverse proxy, caching, load balancing, media streaming, and more. | Certbot: Web traffic on internet is reliably served over Secure Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (https). Certbot is a free, open source software tool for automatically using Let’s Encrypt certifications | DNS: Natively, the web works off of IP addresses.

Preparing the Docker Web Application for Internet Access . There are a couple of steps to this preparation. We need to direct the internet to the Server running the Web Application, this is done using Domain Name Service (DNS). After being directed to the Web Server, the server needs to respond to the Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP), this will be manged by Nginx. Additionally, we will be required to support Secure HTTP (HTTPS), a utility called Certbot will augment our Nginx configuration with a certificate. . DNS provider and setup . Each student scrum team is required to learn how to obtain a DNS provider and setup an independent domain. However, the final set up will be using a Subdomain under nighthawkcodingsociety.com. . A picture is included to show key elements in setting up a domain with a DNS provider. The nighthawkcodingsociety.com is using Freenom as its service provider. As you build your own DNS server you will need to obtain your own IP address and domain. . This illustration is dependent on… . EC2 Public IPs: 3.233.212.71 | Docker Compose Port: 8085 | DNS Name: nighthawkcodingsociety.com | DNS Subdomain name(s): battleship.nighthawkcodingsociety.com. cowboys.nighthawkcodingsociety.com | . A minimum configuration will have the two “A” type definitions using you Public IP address. These two are resolved with a single Web Application. The “CNAME” type is used for subdomains, these will resolve to a different Web Application. . . Nginx install, configuration, and services . Each student scrum team will perform Nginx installation and setup on an AWS EC2 test server. The final configuration will be on AWS server managed by Teachers or Student DevOps Engineers. . Enable Nginx to retrieve Java Web Application on internet request (Reverse Proxy)! Make a server file located at /etc/nginx/sites-available/nighthawk. .

If there are no errors, restart NGINX so the server is an endpoint to the internet: $ sudo systemctl restart nginx . | . Testing HTTP endpoint . Before finishing, this is a good opportunity to test everything you have done. . Direct Test of Web Application Endpoint. This should return HTML related to the home page of the Web site. If this fails, you need to review Docker and docker-compose configurations. $ curl http://localhost:8085; . | Testing unsecure HTTP endpoint on the internet. Go to a browser an type your DNS domain: http://nighthawkcodingsociety.com. Timeout. This means something is wrong with EC2 Public IP. | Nginx Default page. This means DNS is working, but something is wrong with you Nginx configuration. | Broken Gateway. This means Nginx is working, but something is wrong with Web Application endpoint on machine, if this fails something is wrong with Web Application. This requires you to look at Docker and docker-compose configuration. | . | . Certbot install and configuration .

Laurie Santos is a professor at Yale has produced one of the most popular classes of all time at Yale (1 of 4 students take this class). . Teacher Notes . In my first watch of this video, right after 2021-2022 school year, these were my observations in improving the well being of Computer Science at Del Norte. . The Teacher needs to reduce academic stress on students. | The Teacher needs to convince Students to form habits of successful people, as discussed in the video. These habits need to be formed collaboratively between Teacher and Student. | Students need to strive to form an attitude of success for life. This takes effort and commitment. Similar to exercise analogies discussed in video. | In active discussions with Ms Naidu who taught at Del Norte in 2021-2022, we determined the biggest weakness in students our students is Collaboration, not Technical. | Laure Santos request that students be grateful for their current situation. | . Teacher Message . The AP Computer Science classes at Del Norte in 2022-2023 is structured to do most of the work in the classroom. Students, please prioritize the 4C habits: Collaboration, Communication, Critical Thinking and Creativity in classroom. Additionally, focus, ask questions, Code/Code/Code, and make mistakes. If you do these things, you are in danger of getting 90% on all your assignments. . Agile and Psychology of the Good Life .

GitHub Pages is a static site hosting service that takes files straight from a repository on GitHub,runs the files through a build process, and publishes a website. Fastpages is built on top of GitHub pages. Fastpages automates the process of creating blog posts, so you don’t have to manually run conversion scripts. This tour begins by looking at Explorer in VS Code. There are three automations to a GH Pages / Fastpages website... . _notebooks: jupyter .ipynb files. This allows building block of markdown, python, java, javascript into a jupyter notebook. | _posts: markdown .md files. This supports frontend web design with markdown, html, and javascript. | _word: word .docx files. This allows you to save Microsoft or Google documents into a docx format. Saving these directly to _word folder will streamline steps. | . Read more or review files in the fastpages README.md . . Resources . There are many resources, tutorials, and reference for building pages with HTML and Markdown. On these subjects, I would say learn it when you need it. Right clicking on Chrome provides View Page Source on any link on the Web. The APCSA/APCSP projects have many examples within these projects. Here are a couple of Web links I often find through google or refer to when looking for ideas … . HTML on W3Schools | Markdown Cheat Sheet | . Home Page . The Home page is sourced by the index.html file. This is the file to personalize and customize your Fastpages home page. BTW, index.html is the standard name for your web sites landing page. GH Pages / Fastpages builds allows you to mix Markdown and HTML&lt;/mark&gt; within the index.html file. . Sub Pages . Look under _pages folder within the Navigator. In this directory, there are several .md files. These allow a combination of HTML and Markdown. Observe that this project has prefix of 01, 02, 03 on the .md files allows control the order of menus from left to right… . 01_search.md: This provides a very cool search on the site. The search.md is renamed but the contents are untouched from fastpages project. | 02_tags.md: This provide a very cool tagging system that is related to the “categories: categoryname” that are seen at the top of all the GH Pages / Fastpages _posts. This tags.md is renamed but the contents are untouched from fastpages project. | 03_about.md: This page is left for your individual customization, similar to index.html | Developers can add .md file of choice and order according to preference. | . Images . Look under images folder and you will see files added to support the site. Some are for customization of the site others are for pages. . Site: favicon.ico, logo.png | Pages: agile.webp, apcsa.png | . GH Pages YAML files . The _config.yml has many strings and preferences that are specific to the site. The file is full of comments that describe what can be changed and what should remain untouched. Note, the .yml files will be seen again as we begin to deploy our own site with Docker. . Hacks . Personalize index.html file and build your own Fastpages / GH Pages for personal use throughout the year. . Add _pages/notes.md or _pages/vocab.md, insert between tags.md and about.md. Use this area to capture idea and terms throughout the year. | Add some personal study or work pages. Consider how you will use these in conjunction with notes/vocab pages, search, and tagging. Publish _notebook file | Publish _post file with image | Publish _docx file from Google Doc source | . | . Extra Credit . Consider using your home page for other subjects other than Computer Science.

            "content": "Tools and Equipment make Development Easy . Learning Development tools, working with Projects, is the key to a rapid entry into Code/Code/Coding. A Computer, Git, and an Code Editor are the starting points for coding. Add Jupyter Notebooks (computational documents) and you bridge Computer with Data Science. The beauty of Jupyter is that it creates a computational narrative, a document that allows code and data with visual analysis, hypothesis, and conjecture. . Computers using either MacOS, Windows, or Linux are requirements for the course. | GitHub, is Git hosted in the Cloud. It is the defacto hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere in the world. Think of it as the Google Docs for Coders. Version Control is the task of keeping a software system of many versions and configurations well organized. | Version Control History of files and changes in Version Control System (ie GitHub) is very important! Ultimately, any Coder will break things or delete things! Looking at older versions and configurations at a microscopic detail is sometimes the only way to unwind bugs. | . | Visual Studio Code (abbreviations VS Code, VSCode or VSC) is a powerful Code Editor. VSCode performs a lot of magic and automation behind the scenes to make your Code/Code/Coding life easier. There is a back-in-the-day story hear, but short version is VSCode qualifies, IMO, to be called and Integrated Development Environment (IDE). It allows you to Edit files, Build your Code, and Pull/Push Code from and to the GitHub. FYI, VSCode is new to APCS this year, former IDE’s used in CompSci classes include XCode, Eclipse, and IntelliJ. | Jupyter Documents (.ipynb) is a document format for creating and sharing computational documents. These documents allow you to compute segments of Python or Java code as you are taking notes. These are new to AP CS this year, but are viewed as very powerful in gaining a quick understanding of coding concepts. Jupyter documents are often called “notebooks”. | . Equipment, accounts and tools . A laptop, bring a laptop to class every day with the Development Tools installed on it. Computers issued by the School, ie Chromebook, are not effective because of the restrictions placed on adding software by PUSD. If you have any problems obtaining a Computer where you can install software!, please attend Office Hours immediately | GitHub Account, VSCode will be used to clone/push/pull changes.

VSCode Marketplace and Extensions . . Visual Studio Code claims to provide just the tools a developer needs for a quick code-build-debug and version control cycle. It provides a Market Place for enhancements and more complex workflows. Before adding extensions, clone projects and see what is requested or added. Here are some extension that were added through that process or that I have added... . Extension Pack for Java, Debugger for Java: These are fundamental for Java Development | Jupyter: This supports build jupyter ipynb files from within VS Code | Code Spell Checker: Got to have it when building documents, particularly if you spell and typo like the Teacher. | IntelliCode: Got to have it when creating a code file, it will sense type of code by extension. Also, it help with syntax as you are coding. | Java / Spring behind the scenes: Language Support for Java, Maven for Java, Project Manager for Java, Spring Boot Dashboard, Spring Boot Extension Pack, Spring Initializr Java Support, Test Runner for Java | . Review Details in Marketplace for better explanation of purpose of the things explained above. There is a lot more! As you need Git help look at things like Git History and GitLens. Or, perhaps you enjoy Vim and want Vim emulation for editing, their is an extension for that. Later, there may be interest in AWS Toolkit or Deploy extensions. We will learn more about Marketplace Extensions as we do more. . . VSCode for Java .

            "content": "| Overview | Tutorial | Calculator | Binary | Grades | Graph | Life | Snake | . JavaScript Tutorial . console.log output . Output to console using the classic programming introduction using a &quot;Hello, World!&quot; message. . The command or function is console.log() | &quot;Hello, World&quot; is a String literal. This is the referred to as Static text, as it does not change. | &quot;Hello, World&quot; is a parameter to the console.log command. | The console.log command outputs the parameter to the console, so you can see it in this Jupyter document. | Note, in a Web Application, console.log is used for debugging and is not visible from the browser via HTML. It is used behind the scenes, when using Inspect-&gt;Console from the browser. | . console.log(&quot;Hello, World!&quot;); . Hello, World! . console.log output showing use of variable . This second example is a sequence of code, two or more lines forms a sequence. This example defines a variable, then outputs the msg to terminal. . The variable &quot;var msg =&quot; is used to capture the data | The console.log(msg) outputs to console | . var msg = &quot;Hello, World!&quot;; console.log(msg); . Hello, World! . console.log output showing use of a function . This example passes the previously defined variable &quot;msg&quot; to the newly defined &quot;function logIt(output)&quot;. . There are two steps in the code, the definition of the function and the call to the function. &quot;function logIt(output) {}&quot; and everything between curly braces is the definitions of the function. | &quot;logIt(msg)&quot; is the call to the function, this actually activates the function. If you remove this line you will not receive any output to console. | . | Since the variable &quot;msg&quot; was defined in previous cell, it is used a parameter when calling the logMessage function. | . function logIt(output) { console.log(output); } logIt(msg); . Hello, World! . Showing reuse of a function . Now that a function is defined, it can be called from any of the subsequent cell in the Jupyter notebook. A function/method, is a process of creating a procedural abstraction. This a programming practice to promote reuse versus coding the same thing over and over. . First call sends a different string message | Second call sends a number | . console.log(&quot;Reuse of logIT&quot;) logIt(&quot;Hello, Students!&quot;); logIt(2022) . Reuse of logIT Hello, Students! 2022 . Dynamic or Loosely typed language (string, number) . JavaScript is a loosely typed language, meaning you don&#39;t have to specify what type of information will be stored in a variable in advance. The variable type is determined at runtime. This is similar to Python and most interpretive languages. Java which is a compiled language is strongly typed, thus you will see string, integer, double, and object in the source code. In JavaScript, the &quot;typeof&quot; keyword returns the type. . function logItType(output) { console.log(typeof output, &quot;;&quot;, output); } console.log(&quot;Looking at dynamic nature of types in JavaScript&quot;) logItType(&quot;hello&quot;); // String logItType(2020); // Number logItType([1, 2, 3]); // Object is generic for this Array, which similar to Python List . Looking at dynamic nature of types in JavaScript string ; hello number ; 2020 object ; [ 1, 2, 3 ] . Build a Person Function/Class object and JSON . JavaScript functions have special properties and syntax is shown in many ways. In fact, a Class in JavaScript is a special function. Jupyter Notebooks seems to be more friendly to &quot;function&quot; definitions versus &quot;Class&quot;, thus this lesson uses &quot;function&quot; and &quot;prototype&quot; versus &quot;Class&quot;. . Definition of function allows for a collection of data, the &quot;function Person&quot; allows programmer to retain name, github id, and class of designation. | Definition of a prototype allow for the definition of a method associated with the function , the &quot;Person.prototype.toJSON&quot; allows the collection of data to be expressed in a json/string versus JavaScript object. | Instance of a function, the &quot;var teacher = new Person(&quot;Mr M&quot;, &quot;jm1021&quot;, 1977)&quot; line makes a variable &quot;teacher&quot; which is an object representation of &quot;function Person&quot;. | . // define a function to hold data for a Person function Person(name, ghID, classOf) { this.name = name; this.ghID = ghID; this.classOf = classOf; this.role = &quot;&quot;; } // define a setter for role in Person data Person.prototype.setRole = function(role) { this.role = role; } // define a JSON conversion &quot;method&quot; associated with Person Person.prototype.toJSON = function() { const obj = {name: this.name, ghID: this.ghID, classOf: this.classOf, role: this.role}; const json = JSON.stringify(obj); return json; } // make a new Person and assign to variable teacher var teacher = new Person(&quot;Mr M&quot;, &quot;jm1021&quot;, 1977); teacher.setRole(&quot;Teacher&quot;); // output of Object and JSON/string associated with Teacher logItType(teacher); // object type is easy to work with in JavaScript logItType(teacher.toJSON()); // json/string is useful when passing data on internet . object ; Person { name: &#39;Mr M&#39;, ghID: &#39;jm1021&#39;, classOf: 1977, role: &#39;Teacher&#39; } string ; {&#34;name&#34;:&#34;Mr M&#34;,&#34;ghID&#34;:&#34;jm1021&#34;,&#34;classOf&#34;:1977,&#34;role&#34;:&#34;Teacher&#34;} . Build a Classroom Array/List of Persons and JSON . Many key elements are shown again. New elements include... . Building an Array, &quot;var students&quot; is an array of many persons | Building a Classroom, this show forEach iteration through an array and .push adding to an array. These are key concepts in all programming languages. | . // define a student Array of Person(s) var students = [ new Person(&quot;Anthony&quot;, &quot;tonyhieu&quot;, 2022), new Person(&quot;Bria&quot;, &quot;B-G101&quot;, 2023), new Person(&quot;Allie&quot;, &quot;xiaoa0&quot;, 2023), new Person(&quot;Tigran&quot;, &quot;Tigran7&quot;, 2023), new Person(&quot;Rebecca&quot;, &quot;Rebecca-123&quot;, 2023), new Person(&quot;Vidhi&quot;, &quot;unknown&quot;, 2024) ]; // define a classroom and build Classroom objects and json function Classroom(teacher, students){ // 1 teacher, many student // start Classroom with Teacher teacher.setRole(&quot;Teacher&quot;); this.teacher = teacher; this.classroom = [teacher]; // add each Student to Classroom this.students = students; this.students.forEach(student =&gt; { student.setRole(&quot;Student&quot;); this.classroom.push(student); }); // build json/string format of Classroom this.json = []; this.classroom.forEach(person =&gt; this.json.push(person.toJSON())); } // make a CompSci classroom from formerly defined teacher and students compsci = new Classroom(teacher, students); // output of Objects and JSON in CompSci classroom logItType(compsci.classroom); // constructed classroom object logItType(compsci.classroom[0].name); // abstract 1st objects name logItType(compsci.json[0]); // show json conversion of 1st object to string logItType(JSON.parse(compsci.json[0])); // show JSON.parse inverse of JSON.stringify . object ; [ Person { name: &#39;Mr M&#39;, ghID: &#39;jm1021&#39;, classOf: 1977, role: &#39;Teacher&#39; }, Person { name: &#39;Anthony&#39;, ghID: &#39;tonyhieu&#39;, classOf: 2022, role: &#39;Student&#39; }, Person { name: &#39;Bria&#39;, ghID: &#39;B-G101&#39;, classOf: 2023, role: &#39;Student&#39; }, Person { name: &#39;Allie&#39;, ghID: &#39;xiaoa0&#39;, classOf: 2023, role: &#39;Student&#39; }, Person { name: &#39;Tigran&#39;, ghID: &#39;Tigran7&#39;, classOf: 2023, role: &#39;Student&#39; }, Person { name: &#39;Rebecca&#39;, ghID: &#39;Rebecca-123&#39;, classOf: 2023, role: &#39;Student&#39; }, Person { name: &#39;Vidhi&#39;, ghID: &#39;unknown&#39;, classOf: 2024, role: &#39;Student&#39; } ] string ; Mr M string ; {&#34;name&#34;:&#34;Mr M&#34;,&#34;ghID&#34;:&#34;jm1021&#34;,&#34;classOf&#34;:1977,&#34;role&#34;:&#34;Teacher&#34;} object ; { name: &#39;Mr M&#39;, ghID: &#39;jm1021&#39;, classOf: 1977, role: &#39;Teacher&#39; } . IJavaScript and Table formatting using toHTML method . This example builds a Classroom method _toHTML which is passed to the IJavaScript interpreter $$.html which renders output similarly to a real website. . JavaScript in the _toHTML method is broken into three parts... Style part is building CSS inline formatting | Body part is constructing the Table Rows (tr), Table Headings (th), and Table Data (td). The table data is obtained from a Classroom object. The JavaScript for loop allows the construction of a new row of data for each person object in the Array. | Return part creates the HTML fragment for rendering | . | The last line in the example $$.html is IJavaScript HTML interpreter and by passing the parameter of the _toHTML method it obtains HTML to render | . // define an HTML conversion &quot;method&quot; associated with Classroom Classroom.prototype._toHtml = function() { // HTML Style is build using inline structure var style = ( &quot;display:inline-block;&quot; + &quot;background:black;&quot; + &quot;border: 2px solid grey;&quot; + &quot;box-shadow: 0.8em 0.4em 0.4em grey;&quot; ); // HTML Body of Table is build as a series of concatenations (+=) var body = &quot;&quot;; // Heading for Array Columns body += &quot;&lt;tr&gt;&quot;; body += &quot;&lt;th&gt;&lt;mark&gt;&quot; + &quot;Name&quot; + &quot;&lt;/mark&gt;&lt;/th&gt;&quot;; body += &quot;&lt;th&gt;&lt;mark&gt;&quot; + &quot;GitHub ID&quot; + &quot;&lt;/mark&gt;&lt;/th&gt;&quot;; body += &quot;&lt;th&gt;&lt;mark&gt;&quot; + &quot;Class Of&quot; + &quot;&lt;/mark&gt;&lt;/th&gt;&quot;; body += &quot;&lt;th&gt;&lt;mark&gt;&quot; + &quot;Role&quot; + &quot;&lt;/mark&gt;&lt;/th&gt;&quot;; body += &quot;&lt;/tr&gt;&quot;; // Data of Array, iterate through each row of compsci.classroom for (var row of compsci.classroom) { // tr for each row, a new line body += &quot;&lt;tr&gt;&quot;; // td for each column of data body += &quot;&lt;td&gt;&quot; + row.name + &quot;&lt;/td&gt;&quot;; body += &quot;&lt;td&gt;&quot; + row.ghID + &quot;&lt;/td&gt;&quot;; body += &quot;&lt;td&gt;&quot; + row.classOf + &quot;&lt;/td&gt;&quot;; body += &quot;&lt;td&gt;&quot; + row.role + &quot;&lt;/td&gt;&quot;; // tr to end line body += &quot;&lt;tr&gt;&quot;; } // Build and HTML fragment of div, table, table body return ( &quot;&lt;div style=&#39;&quot; + style + &quot;&#39;&gt;&quot; + &quot;&lt;table&gt;&quot; + body + &quot;&lt;/table&gt;&quot; + &quot;&lt;/div&gt;&quot; ); }; // IJavaScript HTML processor receive parameter of defined HTML fragment $$.html(compsci._toHtml()); .

Front-end web development is the development of the graphical user interface of a website, through the use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, so that users can view and interact with that website. In this class, we will be using Fastpages on top of GitHub Pages to maximize our presentations, while minimizing our front-end coding. CSS style layout is provided by using Themes provided through GH Pages. Each page we make we assume the defined theme and insert our HTML fragments, local page style, and local page JavaScript. | Fastpages defaults to the minima theme. Review the the README.md for style or layout customizations. | GitHub Pages deployment is performed through Jekyll, which regenerates the website automatically after each commit, tracking can be seen in Actions tab within GitHub. | HTML generation is performed through Liquid, a template language (similar to Jinja2 or Thymeleaf). | JavaScript enable pages to have actions, fetch content, animate, etc | . . . Sample Code in this Sub Menu . HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are the front-end of the Web. Many tools and languages complement development using markup, style and javascript. This section of the Del Note CS website is providing some code samples. These are intended to spark your own PBL ideas. Each of these were generated after watching others teach or interacting with students. . Tutorial: This is a Jupyter Notebook built using the JavaScript kernel. This provides a few fundamentals of JavaScript language. Pull this file into VSCode and explore the fundamentals of the language. | Calculator: This calculator was inspired by Mr. Mortensen’s calculator that he built in Objective-C during his first year of teaching at DNHS. It was recreated by former student Anthony using GitHub pages, HTML, JavaScript, and CSS in 2022. | Binary: This example was created after watching Harvard CS50 by David J. Malan in 2020, he had built a machine to turn on and off lights/binary digits. My thought after watching machine, why not simulate it in software? Liquid is used to generate the HTML bits and parameters for onclick actions | JavaScript is used base 2, 8, 16 calculations | . | Grades: This grade calculator was created to show interaction of HTML and JavaScript to perform input. Additionally, it show how to add element to HTML Document Object Model (DOM). FYI, the IJavaScript kernel did not support input as of this writing. | Graph: This was created when a student named Bryant 2022 asked me the question “how would I plot data?” as described in an FRQ. JavaScript canvas is used to draw grid, axis, lines | . | Life: This was created by Nathaniel 2022 when I asked him about something interesting to show students in JS that relates to school. Built on Conway’s Game of Life (Wikipedia, Original) | Somewhat pure JavaScript, no canvas usage even though it has a grid. | . | Snake: This was interest of students in each of my 3 years, inspiration and some of the code came from a student named Nolan 2021. Contains menu and settings, as well as Grid | Uses JavaScript canvas and key events | . | .",

Java and API resource definitions are used for RESTful API definitions. Abstraction of Frontend and Backend code, the exchange of standard data format (JSON), and guidelines for exchange (REST) is a technique that saves a lot of time between developers. Learning APIs is a highly recommended step for every developer trying to break into the world of tech. . Covid19: RapidAPI example. This is introducing APIs by accessing something that already exists. RapidAPI shows how many practice RESTful definitions. Almost any data source imagined can be accessed here. | Jokes: An introduction to Java RESTful API libraries. A Java Database is used for the Data Model, providing data persistence. This example introduces concepts like JPA and POJOs. | Database CRUD: A full RESTful API example. This data if properly managed in deployment and migrated when changed can last forever. | . Web API Overview . . A Web API is an application programming interface typically for a web browser. Non-changing or Static Endpoints are used in interacting with the server-side Web APIs. RESTful Web APIs use HTTP methods to access resources via URL parameters, and use JSON for transmitting text between client and server. Server. In these examples, we will be using Java to define REST APIs. Java tools have been around a long time and thus are popular for building RESTful APIs | REST: Representational State Transfer. A set of guidelines on how to architect a network-connected software system. | Client-server: One guideline is a client and server must be decoupled from each other, allowing each to develop independently. | Layered system: The client may access the resources on the server indirectly through other layers such as a proxy or using authentication. This will be clarified by application and security requirements. | . Client. JavaScript is the frontend language used to consume data from the Python defined REST APIs. Fetch will be used to make HTTP requests, as well as handle HTTP response. There are four basic HTTP methods, they align with Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD). | GET =&gt; Retrieve/Read data | POST =&gt; Create data | PUT =&gt; Update data | DELETE =&gt; Delete data | . REST endpoints will have similarity from application to application. In planning APIs, for a Users system you can anticipate key methods. The Users RESTful APIs would likely contain these endpoints. | GET: /users =&gt; Get a list of users | GET: /users(id) =&gt; Get a single user | POST: /users =&gt; Create a new user | PUT: /users(id) =&gt; Update a user | DELETE: /users(id) =&gt; Delete a user | . Once a RESTful API receives and processes an HTTP request, it will return an HTTP response. Included in this response is an HTTP status code. Common status codes are shown. | 200 =&gt; OK, this response will then have the promise of JSON data | 400 =&gt; Bad Request | 404 =&gt; Not Found | 500 =&gt; Internal Server Error (aka bug) | . . . .",
