            "content": "&gt; 6, 7, 8 Lesson!! - toc: true - badges: true - comments: true - categories: [jupyter] . If you&#39;d like, you can follow along with the lessons at these link. . 2D arrays and Arrays | ArrayLists | . Clone this repo (git clone https://github.com/Rebecca-123/rmr-tri3) and work on the hacks below. You can transfer these hacks to your personal fastpages when you&#39;re finished. . Hack 1 . // a) that stores Boolean values ; // b) that stores Turtle Objects ; // c) that initializes with 10 Strings ; . Hack 2 . Choose 3 different methods from above to change around this sample ArrayList: . import java.util.ArrayList; public class Hack2 { public static void main(Integer[] args) { ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt; randomNumbers = new ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt;(); randomNumbers.add(1); randomNumbers.add(4); randomNumbers.add(7); randomNumbers.add(12); randomNumbers.add(23); System.out.println(&quot;ArrayList: &quot; + randomNumbers); ; ; ; } } Hack2.main(null); . Hack 3 . Here is some sample code for the total sum of integers. Finish the loop! . public class Hack3 { public static void main(ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt; values) { ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt; values = new ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt;(); values.add(1); values.add(4); values.add(7); values.add(12); values.add(23); System.out.println(&quot;ArrayList: &quot; + values); int total = 0; for (int i=0; i &lt; values.size(); i++) { ; } } } Hack3.main(null); . Hack 4 . Complete the Selection sort sample code by writing code for a swap of elements. . for (int i = 0; i &lt; arr.length; i++) { // nested loop 1 index ahead for (int j = i + 1; j &lt; arr.length; j++) { // comparing elements int temp = 0; if (arr[j] &lt; arr[i]) { // write the swap code! ; } } // Printing sorted array System.out.print(arr[i] + &quot; &quot;); } . Array and 2D Array Hacks . Hack 5 . Make an array and iterate through it to only print the elements with even indexes (this includes 0). Then iterate through it again to only print the odd indexes. . // code here . Hack 6 . Create a 2D array and iterate through it to print all of its elements. . // code here . Hack 7 . Find the sum of the values on the diagonal of the 2D array. Print the sum. . public class Test1 { public static void main(String[] args) { int[][] array = { {1,2,3},{-1,-2,-3},{4,5,6} }; //ADD CODE HERE } } . Hack 8 . Given an int array, return true if the array contains 2 twice, or 3 twice. The array will be length 0, 1, or 2. . double23([2, 2]) → true double23([3, 3]) → true double23([2, 3]) → false . // code here public boolean double23(int[] nums) { } . Hack 9 . Write a class to count how many of a number n is in a 2d array int[][] x . // code here . Homework! . Write a seating chart program for your group. Meet the following requirements: . A 2D array, array, or ArrayList | A minimum of 3 methods to manipulate the seating chart (ex. alphabetize, shuffle seats, add/replace/delete people) | Print results | . You will be graded on: . Completion of at least 5 of the above hacks | Completion of the homework | Extra credit if you complete a College Board FRQ involving arrays/ArrayLists | . Complete the hacks/homework on your personal fastpages. .",

Fun Scenario -&gt; (Person) wants to sort how big each of his prize winning watermelons are, but he doesn’t have them in order! | Amongst ourselves, we each grab a random number sticky note from a bucket | We all stand in a line, unsorted | (Person) says “how do we sort this??” | Narrator says “we will do a MERGE sort” | then we go into each part involved in the merge sort | Narrator describes each element part of the sort | Meanwhile, there is an associated fastpage that gives code behind each part of the skit AS THE SKIT CONTINUES | Eventually, the sort finishes and the numbers are in order | Teaching - Days 1 and 2 CollegeBoard Units 6-8 (Arrays, ArrayLists, and 2D Arrays) and FRQs 3 and 4 . Teaching plan: Day 1: . Go over terms and exercises and give some time to do hacks | look at collegeboard requirements | look at sample questions | Walk through FRQ 3 and FRQ 4 | . | Day 2: . Walk through the management pbl feature and give time to do hacks | . | Day 3: . Live grading | . | . | . PBL Management Feature . Databases . Team database (all scrum teams) –&gt; store team name and password for login functionality | Assignment database within each team (similar to notes for person) . Many to One: one team has many assignments Each assignment will have link to review ticket, self-grade | TEACHER Role should be able to add final grade | . | . | Team database manages by sub-teams and assignment/scores with Roles | Grading database is for each sub team of other groups and includes grading and comments | .
